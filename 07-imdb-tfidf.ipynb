      "Studio : Universal Year : 2003 Rated : PG Film Length : 78 minutes Aspect Ratio : Anamorphic Widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) Captions : English Subtitles : French , and Spanish Audio : English - Dolby Digital 5.1 ; French and Spanish - Dolby Digital 5.1 . Please forgive my abruptness . I was going to think of a clever rhyme to start this review out with , but after watching this movie , I am so mad that I want to dive right in . Bo Welch 's adaptation of Dr. Seuss ' beloved The Cat in the Hat is a shameful butchering of one of the most popular children 's books ever written - so much so that it is almost not even worth the effort to rip it . No , wait ... on second thought this film deserves to be derided , especially for investing so little effort in recreating the spirit of fun found in the book . Obviously , the book itself is far too short to make a feature film out of , so it needed some padding . I only wish it had not been in the form of excruciating , gaudy , and unfunny live - action comedy , which consists mostly of bodily function humor and crude gags ( some of which are inappropriate for the target audience ) . The ringmaster in this horrific circus , director Bo Welch , was a production designer for Tim Burton once upon a time , so it should come as no surprise that the bold , cartoon - like sets , costumes , and props are the star attraction of the film . In almost every other instance ( Dakota Fanning gives it a good go ! ) , however , The Cat in the Hat is downright awful . To briefly summarize the plot , we get to see how the title character 's unique behavior helps to bring the lives of two very different siblings into balance . While young Sally ( Fanning ) is orderly and mature , her brother Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) is more wild and carefree . When the two kids are left alone with a narcoleptic babysitter by their mother Joan ( Kelly Preston ) , the Cat ( Mike Myers ) appears , intent on teaching the conservative Sally and disobedient Conrad how to let loose and have fun . After the Cat wreaks havoc on the house , the two tykes must try to restore order , clean up the mess , and learn neatly packaged life lessons about what it takes to be well - adjusted children . My question is , with such a simple premise , how did this talented group of people turn The Cat in the Hat into such a woeful , chaotic mess ? ! ? ! Unlike The Cat in the Hat , the other film adaptation of a Dr. Seuss classic , How the Grinch Stole Christmas had a coherent storyline to compensate for its inadequacies . Conversely , The Cat in the Hat is basically an empty fable that puts forth the preposterous notion that the sudden appearance of a magical , mischievous cat can make ill - mannered children see the error of their ways . What is most astounding is that this wide - open premise should have allowed the screenwriters to stretch the boundaries of their imaginations , but they somehow ran out of entertaining ideas just as suddenly as the Cat made his appearance . Indeed , it almost seems as though the filmmakers relied far too much on funnyman Mike Myers to provide give the Cat in the Hat its spark . In this regard , Myers ( who I love ! ! ! ) , who speaks here in grating , insolent tones , was extremely disappointing and unfunny in this movie . It is probably not entirely his fault , but basically , his character is confined to making wisecracks that fall stone dead as soon as they leave his lips , waving his limbs around in manic fashion , and laughing in an extremely annoying manner over and over again . Does n't sound funny ? Once again , this is not exactly my definition of ' ' fun , ' ' and this is coming from a big Mike Myers fan ! All I can hope for is that Mr. Myers does the decent thing and declines to appear in a sequel , if one is offered to him . To sum things up , I found The Cat in the Hat to be a soulless endeavor , completely bereft of imagination , immediately forgettable , and clearly designed to cash in on the financial success of The Grinch . Although this debacle managed to earn over $ 100 million domestically , I remain hopeful that the cool critical reception that greeted The Cat in the Hat will inspire both the studios and comedic actors to think twice before desecrating the memory of any more classic children 's books ! If you value your time , avoid this poor excuse for entertainment at all costs ! ! ! Believe me , it did not receive this year 's Razzie ® award for worst picture for nothing ! SO , HOW DOES IT LOOK ? The hairball that is The Cat in the Hat is coughed up by Universal in anamorphic widescreen , and as much as I hated the film , I must admit that it looked simply stunning on my display ( now fed by a Denon 2200 ) ! Color reproduction ( aside from the slightest bit of dot crawl - see The Cat 's crate and tie ) is first rate , with vibrant cartoon - inspired colors , whites , and flesh tones all appearing just as they should . Black level is also consistent , in both depth and detail , giving the image a rich texture and three - dimensional appearance . Fine detail is extremely impressive , often extending well into the background of a given shot . Further , although edge enhancement is evident on a few occasions , it appears in such moderation that it should n't be a problem for anyone with the ability to sit through the film . Finally , I did not notice any compression related issues , but due to the brief running time of the film , and most of the extras , disc space was probably never an issue . All in all , this is a superb transfer of a very colorful and good - looking film ! Again though , this does not prove to be a persistent problem , and everything else looks so weirdly wonderful you might not even notice it . Bo Welch is very gifted at creating visually appealing shots ; it is just a shame that this Cat did n't have more meat on its bones in other areas ... . WHAT IS THAT NOISE ? The wild and crazy affair that is The Cat in the Hat is presented by Universal in Dolby Digital 5.1 , and let me tell you that this mix makes pretty good use of all six of the channels ! To begin with dialogue is reproduced quite naturally , and is easily discernable even during scenes where the whole house is literally falling down around the characters . Frequency response is also pretty good , although in my opinion the low end did not provide enough reinforcement to the sourced music in the film . Still , the soundstage is incredibly spacious , and the whimsical score by David Newman was recreated exceptionally . Where this track really excels though , is how effectively it turns the chaos inspired by the Cat and his Things into an enveloping experience for the listener . In that regard , the surround channels are very active during several sequences in the film , and help to create a whirling dervish of sound that hits the listener from all angles ! Except for the mediocre bass response during the musical numbers , especially during the first half of the film , this track really left me with nothing else to complain about . Good job , Universal ! ! ! Feature Length Audio Commentary In the feature length commentary for The Cat and the Hat , provided by director Bo Welch and actor Alec Baldwin , the listener is \" treated \" to comments that are screen - specific , mostly trivial , and generally as unfunny as the film is . Indeed , some of their comments are very crude , and at times they are content to simply recite lines from the film before the characters speak them . Well , I 'll quit ranting about it now , before my blood pressure rises any more , and briefly describe some of what I found to be among the very few high points : . --- Bo Welch talks about the difficulty inherent in turning Dr. Seuss ' wonderful short story into a live - action feature film , and why they had to move away from using rhyming . --- Welch discusses the film 's color scheme , which was designed to make the Cat stand out . This was done by using very little in the way of black , red , or white on the sets . --- At several points , Welch and Baldwin reveal concepts that were abandoned , and the use of digital technology to tweak some of the backgrounds in outdoor shots . All things considered , if you can make it through the film , you can probably make it through this commentary track , but I would not recommend it . In my honest opinion , there just is not enough insight offered to make it worthwhile . Deleted Scenes There are a host of deleted scenes ( 16 in all ) , most of which are brief , and also as forgettable as the material in the final cut of the film . Additionally , these scenes play as one continuous reel , and can not be selected individually . The Hat Over the course of this very brief extra , the filmmakers and cast talk about the variety of hats used by the Cat , for either trick shots or as the characters mood changes . \" The Hat \" was somewhat interesting , but it was also over in a flash . The Real Dr. Seuss This quick piece contains an excerpt from an old game show , where viewers seem to have been asked to identify the real Ted \" Dr. Seuss \" Geisel . In addition , Mike Myers and producer Brian Grazer , among others , discuss the impact of Dr. Seuss ' books on their lives , and how Mr. Geisel actually wrote The Cat in the Hat in answer to a challenge . The S.L.O.W. \" The S.L.O.W. \" is another brief extra , which offers some detail on the Cat in the Hat 's car , which has a rather long , silly name . There are a couple of cool shots of the car at various stages of construction provided , as well as a discussion of how the car was driven . The Kids Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin take center stage in this bonus feature , and talk about what it was like working on the project , especially the fun they had with Mike Myers . Director Bo Welch also chimes in , and talks a little bit about the kids ' performances in the film . The Cat Stacks In this mini - featurette , the filmmakers discuss their struggle to translate the book 's image of the Cat in the Hat balancing on a ball , and balancing a variety of items with his hands , onto the screen . The Cat \" The Cat \" is a brief piece that focuses on the development of the Cat 's look . In particular , Bo Welch and the design team talk about the effort to incorporate Mike Myers ' rather expressive face into the final costume , and the process of automating some of the Cat 's costume . Finally , Mike Myers talks about his experiences filming in the suit and extensive make - up . Seussville U.S.A. Over the course of this short featurette , director Bo Welch discusses the creation of the idealized world that the characters in The Cat in the Hat live in . He then walks the viewer through the modifications done to old town Pomona , California , and the construction of the Seussian neighborhood out in Simi Valley ( my neck of the woods ! ) The Fish In \" The Fish \" , the cast and filmmakers talk about the fish , voiced by Sean Hayes , who is supposed to provide the voice of reason in the film . The animators then discuss the process of making sure the fish has an appropriate appearance , and displays the correct emotion , in each scene . The Purrr - fect Stamp This interesting featurette gives the viewer some insight into the process of creating a U.S. postage stamp - from suggestion to final product . The example used is the creation of the cool , colorful stamp celebrating the creative genius of Ted \" Dr. Seuss \" Geisel ! The Music It is probably because I love music so much , but this was my favorite extra on the disc . During this short featurette , composer David Newman discusses his concept for scoring the film , and reveals some of the interesting ( and strange ) modifications done to musical instruments , and the unusual techniques he employed , to attain a \" Seussian sound \" for the film ! Weird , perhaps ... but David Newman 's whimsical approach to devising a score appropriate for the story was certainly very creative . THE LAST WORD If my comments on the film were not clear enough , The Cat in the Hat is an abysmal film that desecrates one of the most creative and popular children 's books of all - time . Really and truly , I can not see how this would be entertaining for anyone over the age of three , and I am getting fed up with the recent trend of substituting bodily function \" humor \" for actual comedy . In terms of presentation , however , Universal stepped into the batter 's box and knocked this clunker out of the park ! The video and audio quality is simply stunning , as vivid , cartoon - inspired colors pop off the screen and whimsical noises whirl about the spacious soundstage . There are also a ton of extras provided , although most are very short , and only a few are really amusing . On second thought , given its target audience , maybe it makes sense to make the extras to be shorter in length , to appeal to children 's shorter attention spans . All in all , I have to give some credit to Universal for putting together a very solid DVD ! That being said , The Cat in the Hat is still such a poor film that I would not recommend renting it , much less buying it . Children deserve intelligent , quality entertainment as much as adults do , so send a message to the studios by avoiding this release like the plague ! ! ! 711 Ocean Drive ( 1950 ) , 24 . Odds Against Tomorrow ( 1959 ) , 23 . Desperate ( 1947 ) , 22 . Pushover ( 1954 ) , 21 . The Blue Dahlia ( 1946 ) , 20 . The File on Thelma Jordon ( 1949 ) , 19 . He Ran All the Way ( 1951 ) , 18 . The Asphalt Jungle ( 1950 ) , 17 . The Killing ( 1956 ) , 16 . I Walk Alone ( 1948 ) , ... . Bit of a shame , as I still say live - action Suess is something to be seen - the problem is n't that it 's live - action , it 's that they had no respect for the source material and becomes just another star vehicle . Still , if it avoids another CITH disaster , that 's good news . I think for some odd reason , The Cat in the Hat was a safer film to bash than the Jim Carrey travesty . Both do equal harm to the memory of the beloved books . Both feature many of the same sins . One was a smash , the other a disaster . Is it really no more complicated than the fact that Jim Carrey is more respected as an off - the - wall physical comedian than Mike Meyers ? The criticial response to this film reminds me of Middle School , how one kid can tell a joke and bring the room down , while another kid can tell the same joke later , and get spitballs thrown at him . It 's not the message , it 's the messanger . Both films sucked , both films were painful to watch , both films do injury to the works of Dr. Seuss . I 'm waiting for Drew Carrey to get cast in Horton Hears a Who , in which Carrey gets dressed up in a plastic elephant suit , and takes his miniature Who to Vegas for fun with slot machines and Who - kers . I absolutely hated The Grinch , but I still want to see this because the trailer looked interesting- if I do see this I 'll try to judge it on its own , and not as a bastardization of the Dr. Seuss story . People in silly makeup are n't my thing , but I do like weird production design . However , since Universal has once again put forced trailers on this disc , I 'll probably end skipping it . If I do get this , I wo n't buy any of the titles advertised . I refused to see the movie the instant I saw a \" Grinch Credit Card \" commercial on TV . American Express , I think . The Movie and everything surrounding it was the very DEFINITION of cross - promotional cash grab . Anything that betrayed the message or the feeling of the book and cartoon THAT badly was n't going to get my money . That and Jim Carrey had pretty much completely forgotten how to be funny by then anyway . Grinch was my choice for worst of 2001 . I see the rest of you going after Cat In the Hat as nothing more than critics paying \" catch up \" . There are no sins in CAT that a free - thinking critic can not also apply to GRINCH . They BOTH sucked . Thanks for the correction ! You are right ! ! ! The morning I finished the review , the Razzies had just been announced , and several different people told me that \" The Cat \" had received the dubious worst picture award . Unfortunately , their web page would not load up for me , so I could not see it for myself , and had no reason to disbelieve my friends . Anyway , although both were absolutely horrible , I think Gigli deservingly received the award . Which do you think was worse ? ? ? Padawan Learner in the Mystical Art of Home Theater ! Display Tweaked to Perfection by Calibrator Extraordinaire Gregg Loewen ! Ya know , whatever . Fact is I liked the Grinch regardless of your feelings on the matter . Cat in the Hat was an awful misguided piece of trash . Nothing wrong for liking one and not the other . The only thing in common is the source author . One worked , One did n't . I 'm not trying to defend either one , just stating how I feel . I 'm done now , time to go cleanse the palate .... . Have to disagree here . House of the Dead remains my personal most hated film of all time . thus winning the 2003 \" worst film \" award , and I would glady watch both Gigli and Cat in the hat again , back to back , to avoid another viewing of HOTD . But otherwise , the review is OK . Mr. Perez simply needs to find new and more descriptive words to describe how horrible this movie actually was . This is harder than it seems since so many films seems to defy description . \" Boiled - shit - served - to - dead - dogs - that - get - stuffed - into - a - dog - house - fashioned - from - vulture - shit - that - gets - set - on - fire \" is the best compound run - on sentence I could fashion to describe how badly this movie stinks . \" Did you know that more people are murdered at 92 degrees Fahrenheit than any other temperature ? I read an article once . Lower temperatures , people are easy - going , over 92 and it 's too hot to move , but just 92 , people get irritable . \" No , it 's the director . The Grinch was given somewhat of a pass not because it starred Jim Carrey , but because it was directed by Ron Howard . It did n't hurt either that it was the first live - action foray into Seuss after his widow opened up the license and that it made millions of dollars right away . With The Cat in the Hat , Bo Welch did n't have anywhere near the cachet of Howard . One other difference between the two movies is the popularity of the source material . The Grinch has appealed to all ages for generations , largely because of its holiday message and the popularity of the wonderful cartoon . Although everyone knows the story of The Cat in the Hat from their childhood , its appeal has largely been confined to a young audience . Itching for live action Seuss ? Look no further than THE 5000 FINGERS OF DR . T. ! Script and lyrics by Seuss . It has become one of my favorite kid 's films . The production design is right out of the good doctor 's artwork ; much more so than either of the recent cinematic abortions . It also has that great touch of creepiness to keep adults interested . Columbia has a cheap DVD out of it with a decent print that really showcases the lovely Technicolor photography . Any Seuss fan worth his weight in ham owes it to him / her / whoself to pick it up . --------------------------------------------- Support Film Preservation before it 's too late ! If it had n't been for my son wanting to see The Grinch , I never would have gone . Thankfully , my son has matured and I did n't have to make the same mistake twice . I was more a fan of the original television specials by Chuck Jones than the books ( although they are charming in their own right ) , and The Cat 's vehicle will be best remembered by me as the \" Moss - covered - three - handled family Gridunza \" . No more live action Seuss films ! Yay ! An animated Horton feature ? Possibly an improvement , but the problem still remains of stretching a 10 minute book ( and 22 minute TV special ) into an 80-plus minute movie still is cause for concern ... What remains of \" The Smurfs \" was only contempt critical of experts and audience , which is the reason for half the fun movie , but the other half lost rhythm , but excels in CGI Smurfs blue left but hatred . It was all right . Really , the saving graces are Jonathan Winters and Hank Azaria 's performances . The worst part is that song ... It 's played over and over and it gets REALLY annoying . Watch it if you like this sort of thing but if you ca n't tolerate tiny voices constantly singing \" lalalalalala \" then stay the smurfing smurf away from this . Horrible dumb movie with lame jokes that are so awful that children were not laughing at them ! ! kids laugh at everything ! also the film took fun source material that is set in a magical land but instead chuck them in new york -_- . If you want to lower your kids ' IQ , then look no further ... this is the perfect film for you . Bad singing , bad characters , bad jokes , bad script ... this is just like Alvin and the Chipmunks ( and that is n't saying much ! ) Formulaic , dull , painful and slow , \" Smurfs \" is a shockingly insult to the America society and a headache for every age . If you think this is overall a decent film , you are either stupid or mentally defective . A boring and un interesting movie . I know this is a kids movie so the jokes are supposed to be clean and stupid but it did n't even do that well . There are so many more better kids movie than this . Acting is awful and just all around terrible . The only kind of good thing I could say is the animation was good bringing animation to the human world . The blue Smurfs do a better acting than the actors , lame . Disgusting few parts that could have been replaced if anyone would 've had some imagination , same for the most of the jokes . Unfortunately for the animator 's jobs which is pretty damn good the movie lacks imagination and it will probably give you a head ache . Anything you want in a good movie ? smurf you ! I was born 10 years after the TV show finished and I watched this movie knowing about Papa Smurf and Smurfette , but nothing else . There were a few parts that were strictly for people half my age , but I really enjoyed this , mostly for the fun of watching the animation . The Smurfs are all adorable , even Grouchy . They look pretty real , and really have spot - on voices , especially Katy Perry as I was born 10 years after the TV show finished and I watched this movie knowing about Papa Smurf and Smurfette , but nothing else .

When the movie came along to The Smurfs franchise I expected allot out of it , but sadly I was disappointed and expect we were all disappointed with the results .

It starts off in the Smurfs village until When the movie came along to The Smurfs franchise I expected allot out of it , but sadly I was disappointed and expect we were all disappointed with the results . What we got in the end was an insulting child racist poorly done , lazy Smurfs movie , and its not worth your money even if you were to see it free . Let me explain why it failed so badly . It starts off in the Smurfs village until they are teleported into the city of New York for some lazy unexplained reason this completely breaks the nostalgia of the Smurf village making the viewers feel out of their comfort zone . Even worse The smurfs tv show was set in the middle ages and for some reason this movie is taking place in the 20 century , it goes against the tv episodes . A few of the Smurf , not all , sadly try to find a place to stay amongst the humans in New York , but because the story is so so poorly told it feels like its going another direction for no reason at all . Its basically a weak story when the Smurfs are trying to get home in between that time waiting for the portal to reappear the events that occur are so dull and mind numbingly out of place . I did n't feel any connection with the Smurfs and what they were trying to accomplish , and so therefore did n't care what was going to happen to the Smurfs in the end . It makes it even worse that the movie does try to make us care about the Smurf , with only some dull emotional scenes , shoe horned in . By the way the voice acting was awful , especially with the Smurfs . The tv show had likeable characters with quirky and unique personalities , and lots of humor . But in the movie we find ourselves with boring characters and terrible writing and there was humor which was terrible and did n't make me laugh once , not even once , in fact the humor was annoying . The acting is horrible , probably one of the worse acting movies ever , and not just with the actors but with the animation . So what you have here is a boring , shallow and uninspiring disgrace to the Smurfs tv show . Do n't watch this movie , and do n't support it in anyway possible , and tell everyone to stay away from it . If you have children and thinking of sharing the movie with them , do n't take them to see this movie . Especially for your children , we do n't need horror like this to torment their innocent minds . If you want to experience the Smurfs franchise then watch the tv episodes of the Smurfs , you wo nt regret it . ... Expand .

There are always alot of risks to bring back cartoons form decades ago and make it popular again and the smurfs has proved again that they 're truly the little people with big hit ! As I always say months ago that this movie were purely \" Saved by The Smurfs ! \" ... Expand . Keeping in mind that this film is mainly catering to a younger audience , I gave the film a 3 . In reality , it deserves a zero . And that statement is n't even true - it 's geared at the actually older audiences who actually watched The Smurfs as kids , since that 's a very very old cartoon and today 's generations probably do n't even know them .

Anyway , the film is just awful . There is nothing positive about it . It uses pathetic acting ( mainly Gargamel and Sofia Vergara who is playing Gloria from \" Modern Family \" basically - or is she just playing Sofia Vergara ? ) , horrible screenplay - the dialogue is pathetic - and it is just not very funny . There is something to be said about a film in which a character makes fun of \" how annoying \" the theme song is . The sad thing is - the song is very annoying ( at least in the rendition in the film ) , as is the whole picture . As I said , I 'd give it a zero , but realising that kids films are usually stupid as it is , I gave it a 3 . Avoid it if you can , for your own good . ... Expand .

He almost had them , but once again , the little blue creatures were able to outsmart their age - old enemy , escaping this time in \" a mechanical wagon\"(taxi ) , by the seat of their white pants . For the moment , while Gargamel figures out the logistics of corralling his most hated nemeses , the wizened old necromancer can bide some time , thanks to the fortuitous hairball that Azarel coughs up . Entangled in the cat 's mucus , to the wizard 's chagrin , are strands of Smurfette 's hair , the color of which is not what Gargamel had selected for the girl 's coif the day that he created her . Goethke , the master of spurious impersonations , in that moment , is a forerunner to Gargamel , a live - action cartoon figure made real through agitprop rhetoric and hateful hate . \" The Smurfette \" is telling . To Gargamel , the Smurfette is a sort of wish - fulfillment ; he gets to live vicariously through her , because being blue is what he most wishes for . In \" Europa , Europa \" , Goethke considers the Nordic race as the gems of the earth , championing light hair and blue eyes as being \" the most glowing example of creation \" . Likewise , Papa Smurf , as a result of sharing the same Nazi ideology , transforms the slightly dowdy , black - haired Smurfette into a terrifying vision of Aryan perfection , introducing the finished produced as being \" new and improved \" , meaning that she is blonde and Nordic - looking . Salomon , in his effort to be more Aryan - like , reattaches the foreskin to his circumcised penis . Presumed to be East Baltic , \" Jupp \" is barely Aryan as is , therefore , barely human , similar to how Smurfette 's new family of blue Aryan youth considers her to be barely a Smurf , due to the girl 's naturally dark hair . Since blue is white in the Enchanted Forest , the blue moon ad that Patrick Winslow creates and Odilie approves for her cosmetics company , becomes an accidental endorsement for Aryan superiority , or rather , blue superiority , without their knowledge . Papa Smurf needs Gargamel ; the totalitarian needs the wizard in order to keep himself in power . In all likelihood , he created the Jewish bogeyman , similar to how the elders in \" The Village \" invented the myth of the monster in the woods as a scare tactic against their people leaving . Papa needs his minions . Those smurfberries are n't going to pick themselves . ... Expand . This review contains spoilers , click expand to view . I really really like this movie ! ! !

However I did find the movie to be slightly entertaining because some of the humor was quite witty and smart . All in all the director failed but the screenwriter saved him . I can see why it would have been relevant back in the 80 's , or heck , even the 90 's , but now , in 2011 ? No . This film simply does n't work . I feel that this film could have been better if it was called \" The Smurfs , Only not the Smurfs From the 70s/80s That we Remember : The Movie \" . Seriously .

If you thought Garfield , or Yogi Bear were a travesty of a film , then you do n't even want to touch this film ( not even with gloves on ) . Worst of all , the film uses an incredibly annoying gag that just does n't work ; this is what I like to call the ' mothersmurfer ' gag . This is when the Smurfs use the word ' smurf ' to replace other words , instead of calling someone a retard ( NOT TO BE TAKEN OFFENSE TO - EXAMPLE HERE ) , they call them a smurftard . All the jokes that come from this are about as well written as a four year old 's comedy act ... If a four year old had curses and bad taste at their disposal . Its awful , do n't waste your money , there are bound to be more family friendly films ( that actually apply to the term family friendly ) to show up this year . Skip this garbage . ... Expand .

There is the Smurf family tale and the human family thread spinning through it that gives it depth . I thoroughly enjoyed the setting in NYC as it takes the absurdity of \" little blue men , \" puts it in your everyday life , and validates it . Who would n't feel good after leaving the theatre . This movie was really really good , it was like Alvin and the chipmunks but in this movie it is Smurf in it :) . but i reccomend this movie to everyone because it was funny and many action in it . It is good that they did this movie with Smurfs i want a Second :D . I 'm not sure making a smurf movie would be such a good idea , especially in 2011 . If it was released back when the smurfs were popular , it would of worked out . I 'm not saying that I hate them , on the contrary , I used to like the smurfs when I was a kid .

Of course , there are some flaws . It has '' cheesy '' humor , the villain Gargamel ( played by Hank Azaria ) was stupid and has other '' cliche '' stuff that you would expect . This kind of entertainment is useless and annoying these days . Hollywood producers , directors or whatever , should stop making these type of movies . Also , has you probably already know , Katy Perry does the voice of Smurfette . She actually did a good job . But it starting to get on my nerves to see singers appearing in movies ( it 's okay if they can actually act ) , leave that to the actors . Anyway , I saw this movie with my little brother , and he liked it . So this movie may be enjoyable for kids , even I surprisingly thought it was better then I expected .

Just why is all I really have to say . The last time these guys were good was back in the 70s and 80s .

I recomend this movie as a movie to see if you have kids that enjoy cute characters and a good villain . This is a great family movie ! Hi guys . First off , I adore the first one ( 4/5 ) and like the second one ( 3.5/5 ) more than I probably should . With that out of the way , here 's my review for Goldmember . Goldmember ( out of 5 ) Sequelitits catches up with Austin Powers in a big way . While the first entry was a surprisingly good time , and the sequel was somehow more entertaining than it probably should have been , the series comes spiraling back to earth with Goldmember . A lazy , paint - by - numbers follow - up that takes great pains to include all the fans ' favorite characters ( and punchlines ) from the earlier films , Goldmember simply lurches along , pushing all the appropriate buttons , yet everyone onscreen seems completely bored with the project by now . Most importantly , it 's simply not very funny . After starting the movie out with an unexpectedly clever tweak on Hollywood moviemaking , Goldmember slowly runs out of steam for the next 80-some minutes . In an effort to keep the Powers - faithful from exploding with rage , star ( and co - screenwriter ) Mike Myers has enlisted all the familiar faces to show up one more time . ( What Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling , two solid participants in the earlier movies , are doing in this film is beyond me . They look as if they were paid to hold the furniture down . ) With the ' casting continuity ' properly squared away , Myers opts to ( once again ) recycle the best gags from Parts 1 and 2 and invents a few new ways for us to laugh at urine , rear - ends , and flatulence . He has a gold ... member . Not one . No kidding . If you thought the addition of the Fat Bastard character ( as played by yet another Canadian comedian named Mike Myers ) signaled the end of the Austin Powers franchise , wait till you see the stupidity that is Auric Goldmember . With a massive bulge in his crotch and a predilection for eating his own dead skin , the titular character is a gaping black hole in the middle of this tiresome farce . Not content to simply add a new villain to this sequel 's ridiculously overcrowded stable of characters , Myers also offers a new femme fatale named Foxxy Cleopatra ( the charming Beyonce Knowles ) and a previously unmentioned father figure played by Michael Caine . My initial reaction upon hearing that Caine took this role was that of bemused anticipation ; after seeing the film , I 'm wondering why Caine even bothered . In other words , he ( like over half the cast ) is given virtually nothing to do . Even the affable Seth Green , generally employed as a breath of delightfully acerbic air in the earlier movies , is totally wasted here . Goldmember is all about going - through - the - motions . You can almost see the filmmakers checking off items on their list of Austin Powers ' requirements ' . Gone is the freewheeling playfulness of the original movie ; it must be near impossible to maintain that sort of subversive freshness when you 're now responsible for a movie studio 's biggest cash cow . Are there a few laugh - out - loud moments to be found in Goldmember ? Sure , but you have to sift through a whole lot of tiresome moments ( too numerous to mention ) , pointless cameos ( Nathan Lane ? ) , and self - referential in - jokes that would be a whole lot funnier ... if the joke were n't on the audience . While neither International Man of Mystery or The Spy Who Shagged Me could hardly be considered works of filmmaking brilliance , the third entry displays a stunning ineptness at simply telling a story . I realize that the film is meant to be nothing more than a series of comedy set pieces , but the first two entries at least had A - B - C plots that you could follow along with . Without some sort of narrative structure ( however flimsy ) , your ' story ' becomes a ' variety show ' . Goldmember is a series of indulgent character introductions ( and re - introductions - as if anyone seeing this film somehow missed the first two ) , lazily attempted exposition scenes , and a whole lot of belabored bits . ( Fred Savage with a massive mole on his face : funny for about 14 seconds , right ? Yet this gag is milked as feverishly as would be the world 's last cow . ) Every 15 minutes , I found something supremely amusing in Goldmember . Unfortunately , that equals out to about 6 solid laughs spread over 90 minutes ; you 'll find more than 6 laughs in the first ten minutes of the first Austin Powers adventure . On the other hand , if you think the accident - prone midget Mini - Me ( Verne Troyer ) represents the pinnacle of American comedy , Goldmember may be your new favorite film . The diminutive guy deserves top billing here . As for Myers , he does strike a handful of solid yuks , but it 's plain to see that his heart is n't in it ... or maybe he 's just exhausted from playing seventeen frantic characters . Much like this summer 's Men in Black sequel , Goldmember is rife with threadbare and off - puttingly familiar humor , rehashed concepts ( most of which were not all that amazing to begin with ) , visibly bored performers , and a shockingly shallow devotion to overt product placement . ( I counted 6 in the first 25 minutes . ) Once again , the moviegoing public is essentially punished for making one small movie a massive hit . It 's only logical to assume that a moneymaker like Austin 1 would spawn a sequel ( or four ) , but that does n't mean they have to be so damned generic . Far from the worst sequel ever made , but surely you have better things to spend 9 bucks on than ' far from the worst sequel ever made ' . Hello all . I just viewed this film as well and I found it to be absolutely hilarious . The whole point of these films are not to give us something Oscar worthy or anything , but good old fashioned fun . One of the purposes of comedy is to make the audience laugh , and laugh I did at this film . The whole opening sequence was such a shock to me that I and the people I was with were just rolling in the seats . True , the film is full of toilet humor , but that 's one of things one looks forward to in an Austin Powers film . In addition , I felt the acting to be very good in this film with the addition of Michael Caine as Nigel Powers as well as Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra . I felt that their contributions to the film were very good . Another element of comedy is the running gag . This time around , we see the use of the \" Mole \" as a running gag . Every time it came up , I found it hilarious . Finally , I must say that Verne Troyer totally rocks this time around as Mini - Me . Just like in The Spy Who Shagged Me , he steals every scene he is in . Overall , this film was surprisingly a good sequel in a Hollywood that is full of way too many sequels that should have just stayed on paper . \" It 's been my lifelong ambition to be a movie usher , and I have failed , as far as I am concerned \" - Bob Dylan . I 'll keep it short and sweet . First Five Minutes of Goldmember : 10/10 The Rest of Goldmember : 4/10 Overall : 5/10 Not terrible , but not terribly funny . I got quite bored , quite fast . A few inspired moments ( the beginning , the rap video ) save it from being completely mediocre . Scott summed up my feeling on the participants rather well - show up , do your bit , thanks for playing . Lame ending . But a great opening . And I do mean GREAT ! Take care , Chuck . The characters gave me consistent laughs throughout the movie but the best laughs did come in the first half hour . It just slowly went downhill from there and I did n't like the ending much . The Goldmember character was n't funny at all . Every scene he was in he just seemed to drag the movie down . Nothing he said ever made sense so it just was n't funny to me . Beyonce managed not to annoy me like Heather Graham did so that was a plus . Overall , not a bad way to kill 90 minutes . The creative person is both more primitive and more cultivated , more destructive , a lot madder and a lot saner , than the average person . - Frank Barron . What do you say about the first 5 minutes besides that they are arguably the best of the movie . And you know what . That is n't nessecarily a bad thing . I got more belly laughs out of this one than the last one and got them on a more consistent basis . There really is n't a plot to speak of other than Dr. Evil wants One billion bajillion [ ... ] dollars and in order to get that he threatens to flood the earth by pulling an asteriod made of gold into the polar ice caps thus melting them . Why the asteriod is made of gold , we never know . Why Goldmember is involved , we never really understand . Why it 's important that Austin Powers 's father is kidnapped , we do n't care . This is the worst written of the 3 but it also could quite possibly bethe funniest . : : gasp : : It will take more viewings of Goldmember to attach that title else we be to hasty . The main reason I give for even saying it could be the best ( and worst ) is from the cameo by the Osbournes . In 30 seconds Ozzy sayes what we 've all been thinking throughout the movie . \" Boobs . These writers are boobs . That says it all . Sure they are reused jokes . Frankly the writers and I do n't care . They are damn funny when they work and that 's what matters . I just wish they could have made the movie a little more coherant . If it had been written better and perhaps even let it go longer than 90 minutes , it most definely would have been he best so far . / Best Line : \" Hey Assholes ! \" - Danny DeVito . Daddy , what does it say at the top ? I ca n't read it . Father : There are few who can . The language is that of Mordor , which I shall not utter here . Child : Mordor ? Father : In the common tongue , it reads , ' One ... . I laughed so hard I was crying . Every character has his / her moments in this film . Sure the movie is making fun of itself . But it is still really funny . So they are still funny and even shocking . For example : The radar screen joke was predictably there in the film , but Cmon , they made it funnier . The \" behind the screen \" shadow joke is in there again , but it is funnier this time around . Heck , they even used some of the really bad jokes from when most of us were kids ( you know the \" sea men \" joke ) and all that . This whole movie parodies itself , brings in enough new things , and everyone in the theater I was in was laughing hysterically . This movie should do well . 8.5 of 10 ( SPOILER FREE REVIEW ) This is on par with the previous 2 films except perhaps for one flaw - too many gross jokes . If you thought 2 had more gross jokes than 1 , wait till you see this one . HOWEVER , I was surprised by the number of twists on the original jokes there were , and even when they retread some ideas they are either still funny or are making fun of themselves . The story is a bit jumpier and awkward than 2 even was , but they throw a million gags at you and at least some of them stick . I laughed heartily many times in the film , especially at the film references . I am pleased to say that within 2 seconds of the start of the film I got the first reference , but it was still even funnier than I thought it would be . Probably the funniest 5 minutes of the series . There are many good film references , my favorite being a prison one based off a series of films including a remake of one that is on its way next year . But the audience did n't laugh as much at that as me . I 'm alone in my reference world I guess as I often was laughing just on the setup itself before the joke was even there . And to me there were a couple that were a tad too obvious ( do you have a little clone in you ? - who does n't know that punchline , yet the audience seemed surprised by it , so go figure ) . Hey , if you do n't like Austin Powers , why are you reading this ? If you do then you are going to get more of what you enjoyed , but a bit grosser . Count me in as one of those who liked this one . Sure it has alot of the same \" types \" of jokes as the other ones but it is still a pretty entertaining 90 minutes . Like others have mentioned , the first 5 minutes are hilarious . I was completely surprised and laughed my A$ # off . I thought it was a worthy member of the Austin Powers series . I give it out of . This movie was damn funny ! I think most people know what to expect when they go see an Austin Powers movie , and in that respect , Goldmember keeps to that tradition while keeping alive the pure fun of the sight gags which had me ROTLMAMFAO . The opening 5 minutes were definitely very funny ( I 'm so glad I knew of it ) , and got the movie off to a good start . The rest of the movie had a very paperthin plot , but no one goes to Austin Power movies for plot , they go for laughs and attitude , and this movie has it in spades . I will add that I thought Beyonce Knowles did a nice job , and had good screen presence ( was not awkward , and did n't seem out of place at all ) . I thought it was quite funny- and so did the rest of the audience in the theatre with me . It was on par with the other two films in my opinion . 3 stars out of 4 . Saw this movie at a sneek peak after work and damn if I did n't love it . After seeing two stinkers in a row with the incredibly crappy Eight Legged Freaks and the promising but non - delivering Reign of Fire I 'm glad this movie broke my streak . Those two movies had me wondering why the hell I had spent my money and was sitting in a theater when I normally do n't go to the movies but wait for the dvd instead . AP3 had me rolling in the aisles and happy to be there sharing in the belly laughter of everyone in the audience . If you have a good audience when you go see this film you 're guaranteed to have a good time if you know what to expect . I highly recommend this movie to any fans of the first two because in my opinion this one is the funniest of the bunch . In the end only the fittest survive in this world .

There 's a scene in \" Austin Powers in Goldmember \" that reflects my entire feeling of the film . In a trainwreck of a scene , our beloved Austin Powers makes fun of a character with a mole on his nose . He ca n't stop making fun of it , and it infuriates not only the character , but his boss standing beside him . The boss keeps making these \" shut it \" motions to him , and then finally yells \" Shut up ! \" in anger . I mention this because \" Goldmember \" does n't realize that beating a dead horse is not funny . What 's worse , is that nothing in \" Goldmember \" is funny on purpose OR by accident . It 's either heavily scripted and far too timed to take on any relevance of surprise , or a sequence is dragged on forever because it 's too scared the audience is n't in on the joke . And there I go again , giving the impression that there was actually anything funny to begin with . There 's not really much of a plot here . Mike Myers is playing everyone again , from Dr. Evil , to Austin Powers , and now the Dutch Goldmember , who wants to take over the world with a tractor beam which , like his favorite object , is pointed right at a gold asteroid . Also , Goldmember has kidnapped Austin 's pappy , Nigel , played by Michael Caine ( ! ) , which sends Austin Powers back to 1975 , and then meeting up with Foxxy Cleopatra ( Beyonce Knowles ) . And So On . I feel like I 've explained a plot here , but I feel like I 've explained nothing . I just did n't care . I did n't care that Dr. Evil 's son Scott ( Seth Green ) is showing Anakin Skywalker - ish signs of becoming evil . I did n't care about Austin and daddy Nigel 's shortcomings . I did n't care that Mini - Me wants to join the good side after having a fallout with Dr. Evil . And So On . Speaking of jokes , they try here , but they fail . A subtitles sequence , featuring all - white titles being obscured by light to show dirty words being spoken , is amusing only in how poorly it is set up . In another , we watch as Austin hides in a Sumo Wreslter laundry basket while Sumo diapers are being thrown in , one at a time , on Austin 's face , which finishes with Fat Bastard 's pair , which , of course , is n't clean . Or how about the numerous musical numbers that just ... aren't ... funny . And So On . Did Jay Roach or Mike Myers even learn anything from the last film ? Mike Myers should really make some new characters in a new series . He has lots of talent , and has no doubt shown it on Saturday Night Live and in many films . Beyonce Knowles ( of Destiny 's Child ) , is perfectly wasted , all built up to be a Blaxpoitation Queen , and then placing her beside Austin to look good . And I have yet to discover how the terrific Michael Caine chose to appear in this nonsense . It 's Michael Caine in name only . And no insulting of moles . And So On ..... Note : I appreciate all the positive feedback that this film has recieved , and I respect all opinions posted here , but I 'm sorry , I REALLY think this movie is a pile of doo - doo . I think it 's the worst film of 2002 and deserves to bomb , so we can never see another Austin Powers movie again . But if you hate me because of this review , well , that says something about you , does n't it ? [ /i ] . Buy National Treasure on DVD today ... \"The best movie I saw on Saturday night from 7 pm to 9:30 . The DTS track is freakin ' awesome ! \" --Multiplex Drone . I consider myself to be a huge Austin Powers fan , mostly due to the second film , which I rank as one of my all - time favorite comedies . With that being said , I was also somewhat let down by Goldmember , though I must admit , I was howling in laughter several times throughout . The film starts off with a bang , and I pray that no - one in this forum ruins it for anyone . The opening 10 minutes is the best that the film offers , and from thereonin , the film starts to lose steam . I think the main problem with the film lies in the fact that it 's getting hard to keep this series fresh , mostly due to the fact that most of its jokes derive from potty humor . Many of the gags that worked so well in the second film are simply rehashed here , and as someone else mentioned , it 's almost like beating a dead horse . This is not to say that Goldmember is a complete letdown -- it tis not . There are truly some gut - wrenching belly laughs to be had throughout this film , but alas , they come too far inbetween many of the potty jokes that will have your eyes rolling . Mike Meyers is starting to show some age , resulting in a heftier and slightly older looking Austin Powers . You can also see the weight gain in the face of Dr. Evil . On the other hand , Mini - me is just as cute as ever , and he gets a lot of great comic screen time here . The worst part of this movie is its title character , Goldmember , who is a complete and unfunny annoyance . Perhaps Meyers should have gone with one of his more successful Saturday Night Live characters and titled the film , Austin Powers : Coffee Talk . Although the villain might have started feeling a little veklempt , at least it would have been a better villain than this one . One of the nice things that Meyers did here was make the film more than one dimensional , making Goldmember a film within a film , which really adds to the film 's overall humor . I was really hoping for something a little better to end the Austin Powers trilogy . It 's a shame that Goldmember ends on such a flimsy note . Ronald J Epstein Home Theater Forum co - owner .

Jason , I totally agree with almost everything you said . Being myself a BIG Austin Powers fan , I hated this . I laughed maybe twice the whole way through and the rest I found to be an utter bore . I loved the first movie and even liked the second one quite a bit . This one was a huge disappointment for me . PS . I agree completely with your assesment of Undercover Brother , a much more enjoyable and funny movie than this . What a great addition this movie was to the Austin Powers series . Was this Steven Spielberg 's first cameo ? HILARIOUS . Although I felt like I was the only one who got the Silence of the Lambs references . The theater was quiet during this scene . Our theater was SOLD OUT . I noticed more families compared to the previous films . I personally do not believe that the AP films are generally movies kids should see . And there were a lot of kids in the theatre . ( Under 13 ) You would think that they would get maybe half the jokes ? Anyway ... / Solid gold[member]. Has the Downfall of Mike Myers Truly Begun ? If you went down to your local movie theater today and asked any average moviegoer who they thought was funnier , either Adam Sandler or Mike Myers , the answer you would hear most often might shock you . Sandler 's summer flick , You Do n't Mess with the Zohan , was a flop itself with a box office revenue of only $ 80 million so far . That should 've give away the answer already : Mike Myers . But the earnings have start to trickle in for Myer 's The Love Guru and it does n't sound good ( or maybe it does ) . Guru only made a pitiful $ 5.4 million on Friday and is expected to hit $ 15 million by the end of the weekend , nearly 50 % less than Zohan 's opening weekend . However , I 'm not here to talk about actual earnings and the revenue potential of Myers , I 'm here to talk about the decline of a comedian who once was funny . Back in February I posed a similar question after Semi - Pro failed at the box office : Is Will Ferrell Burning Out ? In retrospect , I realized that was more of a talking point than an actual theory , primarily because Semi - Pro was a problem itself . Ferrell 's Step Brothers is going to hit big this summer , that 's pretty much guaranteed . It may not blow the roof off of the box office like Superbad , but it will at least be a much stronger performer than both Zohan and Guru . And that answers Ferrell 's question - he 'll be good as long as he 's in the right movies . Myers , on the other hand , is n't working like this . The Love Guru is his first on - screen performance since 2003 and it 's downright atrocious . And now that it flopped financially , it 's time to ask : is this the start of his downfall ? There was a time , back in the early 90s , where Mike Myers was a comedian with true talent . Wayne 's World and So I Married an Axe Murderer both became instant classics and set a precedent for Myers . In 1997 , he debuted his greatest character - Austin Powers . Then again in 1999 , he followed it up with a great sequel , titled The Spy Who Shagged Me . But when the world celebrated a new millennium , it seemed like Myers started to lose his edge . He did a great job voicing Shrek in 2001 , but 2002 's Goldmember had lost that magical disco spirit that made the first two Austin Powers movies so great . And in 2003 he hit a new low - The Cat in the Hat . Now five years later he \" returns \" and it 's even worse than before . With a solid six years of evidence , I can certainly say it seems like Myers is already picking up speed in his downfall . I 've already shared my utter distaste for The Love Guru in a previous article and thankfully it seems the world has come to agree with me as well . The film has a measly 16 % on Rotten Tomatoes , with the only positive reviews coming from a few no - name critics , and barely made enough money to even make a dent in its rumored $ 62 million budget . I guess this goes to prove that great marketing means nothing if the movie looks like complete shit . I have no remorse for Myers and The Love Guru and can smile when I say that I 'm happy to see him fade away . His comedy has become so over - used and washed up , that I 'd rather pay money to watch So I Married an Axe Murderer again than see The Love Guru for free . So to tie this all together with the opening question , I 'm amazed to hear that people actually prefer Myers over Sandler when he 's already six years into his downfall . What 's so great about his comedy that makes him loved by so many people ? Or is it simply his adherence to such iconic characters like Austin Powers and Wayne Campbell that they 've come to appreciate him for what he once was and not what he currently is - a comic on his way out the door . I really hate to speak so negatively about a comedian that I at one time did love myself , at least back when I was younger and when Austin Powers was funnier . Whereas I might have been wrong about Will Ferrell , I do n't have any doubts about Myers this time . So let 's ask the audience again ... Has the downfall of Mike Myers truly begun ? well look on the bright side , atleast The Incredible Hulk could make it big no . 1 for a second week . Spider . I do n't believe that the downfall of Mike Myers has started . The reviews for this flick suggested a stupid - funny(or stupid - stupid ) movie , with a not very interesting lead character . Shades of an Austin Powers wannabe lingered in many minds , including mine . I 'm sure we 'll all be there in line if we get another Austin Powers flick . By the way , I saw \" Get Smart \" and it was good ! Garrett.king . I was pretty sure that from Elf onwards , all were the worst of Will Ferrell . But he 's done one film since Elf that I 've actually liked , and that was Stranger Than Fiction . I have to say , on the Myers side of the argument . I preferred Goldmember over the other Austin Powers movies . I loved the opening to it and it was funnier . anyone who 's read my thoughts on Myers on the other page about The Love Guru knows what I think . Poor Myers is done . Pickle . Funny ! The same sentiment was echoed when Jim Carrey 's \" Fun With Dick and Jane \" under performed . The best thing about Hollywood is that with the right script and great decision - making from the actors they can skyrocket to a higher level of super stardom at any given time ! Best example : Robert Downey Jr. . Thoughtless . Darrin : Not happening . Estimates show Get Smart debuting at $ 39 million . Besides that fact , The Incredible Hulk is going to drop 61 % to around $ 21 million . Hell , Kung Fu Panda is tracking at that same amount so TIH may actually fall down to third with KFP edging it out with a 35.4 % or better drop . Basically the best TIH can do is second , and the worse is third . As for the article itself . Calling Zohan a flop is a stretch in itself . Sure , it has a higher budget than most Sandler movies , but box office wise it will meet and exceed that number even if by a tiny amount ( Not counting marketing / promotional ) . Overseas wise and DVD sales will probably determine if it is a flop . However , I do n't think it is a success . More like a below average performance . A very below average performance . Prince Caspian is a flop . The Love Guru is a flop . These are movies that wo n't make their budget in the states ( overseas Caspian will do it ) . Then again , the use of the word if ' flop ' is relative , I use it to label movies that performed abysmal . I do n't think Mike Myers is done . Is he in a downfall ? No doubt about it . But this is hollywood and a turn around is always possible ; Eddie Murphy 's late career . I do n't think it is Myers himself , acting wise , that is doing this fall , but it is the projects he is attached to . Creativity wise , he has been in some movies that range from god awful ( Cat in the Hat , Love Guru ) to completely lackluster ( Goldmember ) . For me , as a fan , I am just tired of the same thing . Myers is n't bringing anything new to the table . It feels like he is beating the same drum over and over . What Myers needs to do is take a break and tackle something new . Maybe a drama . Maybe a different brand of comedy that does n't involve toilet or slapstick humor . Maybe he needs to try something new . Knocked Up and Superbad proved that you do n't need a mega a - list star and a giant budget to make a good , entertaining and successful comedy . What Pickle said earlier is right . The right script and good decision making can easily turn around a career . But if you keep sticking to the same thing you 'll end up a joke . Alex . Should n't a downfall at least have two or more movie included . It 's one movie . I 'm not defending him . The movie blows hard . But let 's give him another chance to prove us right and bring out another flop . But something tells me with \" The Crap Guru \" having such low marks , a 4th Austin Powers will be on its way . And Verne Troyer should thank God for that because that 's the only time he ever gets work . Personally , I 'd rather have another Wayne 's World , but I 'm sentimental like that . Devon Shaw . In short : Yes . The dirty secret is , Mike Myers has n't been funny in quite a long time ... the first Austin Powers movie was like striking gold , but midway through the second movie it was pretty obvious he was just milking it for as long as it 'd go . From a personal standpoint , I have n't laughed at Myers since Wayne 's World ... but Axe Murderer was enjoyable for what it was . What this really is , is yet another SNL actor living on borrowed time . As the Queen Victoria loved to say , \" We are not amused . \" Reverend . Eddie Murphy 's late career has been terrible , and it seems to be getting worse ( Meet Dave ? Are you kidding me ? ) Probably not even the return of Beverly Hills Cop will revitalize his career , although it 's his best shot . I think Mr. Billington is right- Mike Myers is done . Yeah , he might continue making movies , but he 's run out of material . I certainly do n't think I 'll watch any more new Myers movies , not even a return of Austin Powers . Goldmember killed that character . Although I think you make a good point , Thoughtless . If Myers is smart enough to try something completely different , I might come back for him . I may be alone here , but I thought Sandler was best in Punch Drunk Love . \" Begun \" ? Marqwest . Why was this article not written after Shrek the Third ... was it not obvious from the trailer for \" The Love Guru \" that this was happening ( no pun intended ) . Btw Sandler delivered an amazing performance in \" Reign Over Me \" as well . Conrad . In response to # 1 , what the hell does bringing up the Hulk have anything to do with the question : \" Has the downfall of Mike Myers begun ? \" have to do with anything ? ? ? ? Especially for the first person writing on this forum , that 's a waste . Number 10 , \" Reign Over Me \" was a dramatic performance by Adam Sandler , far from comedic . The Shrek movies got worse as they went along . I did n't even bother to see Shrek 3 cause it looks like absolute garbage - so I hear , it was . \" Cat in the Hat \" - yep garbage too . \" Goldmember \" had a great opening sequence , great cameo w / Speilberg , Cruise , Spacey , Paltrow and DeVito . But the rest of the movie was pretty lame . Not to mention the ending ! - Truly a disappointment . I think its time for Myers to either come up with better ideas or team up with someone else i.e. Will Ferrell and make a hit . Cause \" The Love Guru \" looked like garbage from the first time I heard of it , let alone the first time I saw the trailer . - Considering Alex of FS.net 's review and 16 % on Rotten Tomatoes tells me I was right . Couple more things : \" Punch - Drunk Love \" and \" Stranger Than Fiction \" were not your traditional comedies - they both fell into the satire genre . I would n't exactly call $ 80 million a flop , especially since Zohan has broke even . Thoughtless . Actually , looking back , I want to retract my mention of Eddie Murphy ( And him turning his career around ) . For some reason I was under the assumption that Eddie had something else going for him aside from the Dreamgirls fame . But looking at the list of movies he made in recent years , if you take out the Shrek series , it is just horrible . Norbit ? The Haunted Mansion ? Daddy Day Care ? I Spy ? I confused a sudden blip of good fortume ( Dreamgirls ) with a turn around . Also , I agree with Reverend . Meet Dave ? Who comes up with this stuff ? Seriously . To make a comment on the Mike Myers ' question . He has n't really had that huge of a film career to truly say he 's having a downfall . Love Guru was only like Myers ' eighth staring role ( not couting Shrek ) and five of those roles were either the Wayne 's World or Austin Powers movies . Myers ' problem may be more that he insists on creating his own characters than staring in films written by other people . Ricky . Meyers has a limited amount of ammunition in his comedic arsenal , which means he 'll only be appealing in times when his sort of comedy is big . When Waynes World and Austin Powers were out slapstick was pretty big , and so was toilet humor . If you released \" Something About Mary \" today , I do n't think it would do as well as it did back in the 90 's . Meyers is n't necessarily washed up , he 's just pushing a type of crap that is n't going to float in todays comedic waters . What seems pretty big right now are ensemble comedies . The Apatow gang are dominating because they stick together , and the same can be said for Will Ferrel and his crew , Ben Stiller / Owen Wilson and company , and most importantly to this discussion Adam Sandler . He has really grown as an actor , but he 's done it while still working with the same group of guys . That guys career should be done , but he 's still around not because he stars in great movies , but because he sticks with good comedic actors .... who on their own would make terrible movies ( see Rob Schnieder films ) , but as a collective group do really well . Meyers , and Eddie Murphy for that matter would do themselves a favor by working in a good ensemble comedy . I think they 're both kind of egotistical , and want to be the star . Unfortunately I do n't think any comedic actor has staying power as a star . Jim Carrey ca n't even do it anymore , and he used to be off the charts funny . Now he 's just average , and I expect the same fate for Steve Carrel eventually . He 's riding high right now , and he 'll probably stick around in some capacity because he 's been a part of the Apatow / Will Ferrel groups in the past , but as a lead he 'll fade . So to answer the question , yes Meyers is past his prime , but that does n't mean he 's washed up . It just means he needs to fall in line and work on projects written by other people , and with other comedic actors who have in their own right fallen a bit . The ensemble cast is like giant net that seems to be launching and catching comedic actors as they rise and fall . I do n't want to see Meyers go out on the bottom , so hopefully he finds an ensemble comedy to shine in . interloper . How did they spend 62 million on this piece of trash ? Not the same genre , but for example , Serenity was filmed for 44 Mil , and is beyond infinitely better than Guru will ever be . I will always love Waynes World and Austin Powers , but he does seem to be losing it bad . Reverend . @11 , nobody was claiming that Punch Drunk Love , Stranger than Fiction , or Reign Over Me were traditional comedies . In fact , that was mostly the point . These actors can perform at a higher level when they are not in one of their traditional roles or movie styles . Movie Lover . I am one that never got the Austin Powers thing . I saw the first one in the theater . Barely laughed . There were painful , long moments of silence when really godawful jokes were made . So I never saw another one . I am not surprised this movie tanked . If Austin Powers was a D in my book , I 'm guessing this was beyond F. Mike Myers should stick to Shrek voiceovers . Jeff . Yes , in fact his downfall is about halfway through I 'd say . Tom . Axe Murderer an \" instant classic \" ? Is this a joke ? Brett . I am always amazed that people love to put he boot in and see other people fail . I intend to see The Love Guru . I think Myers is just giving people what they want and expect from him . crabby . Yes . Mike Myers has \" jumped the shark \" . You can give people what they want and do new things at the same time . Maybe this is the biggest fault in having a movie with a singular vision . Apart from hearing that Myers is an absolute ass on the set , I think the problem stems from the fact that everyone thinks he 's some sort of comedic genius and therefore no one around him dares say the word \" No \" . \" No , that 's not funny . \" \" No , that script sucks . \" \" No , I wo n't give you $ 15 million to star in that film . \" \" No , I wo n't go get you another latte because that one is not 135 degrees exactly . \" Myers is , at best , a B level skit actor being treated like an A level comedian . He should allow others to write his scripts , and immerse himself in the various characters that they create for him that he excels at so well . Comedic genius should be reserved for the like of George Carlin , who passed away last night . It 's hard to talk someone down if they made one of the most quoted / referenced franchises in the last decade . I think he just ran out of accents ; he used them all in the last Austin Powers . I think that the downfall of Mike Myers has been going on for a bit . I do nt think that Shrek was too great for his career . While they made a lot of money it is important for an actor to have more face time in front of an audience in my opinion instead of just voice work . All I can say is that We have a piper down , We have a piper down ! ! ! Fatty . There are so many things wrong with this article . Zohan is not a flop . $ 80 million after 3 weekends is what all Sandler 's movies do . It 'll end up in the low hundreds domestic , like all the others . Step Brothers is not going to be a big hit . It will not be a \" much stronger performer \" than Zohan . Why would you assume this ? So I Married an Ax Murderer was an instant classic ? Huh ? If 2002 's Goldmember had \" lost the magic \" and 2003 's Cat in the Hat was \" a new low \" , how can Guru be the start of Myers downfall ? Do you think Valkyrie might be the start of Cruise 's downfall ? Was the 2006 \" Longest Yard \" the start of Burt Reynold 's downfall ? Was stealing his memorabilia back the start of OJ 's downfall ? \" Great marketing means nothing if the movie looks like complete shit \" - how can it look like complete shit if the marketing is great ? And did Guru really have great marketing ? What are you talking about ? People actually prefer Myers to Sandler - based on a scientific survey of two people ? Why do n't you curl up with your laserdisc copy of Ax Murderer and leave the \" analysis \" to people who have a clue what they 're talking about ? Cmurder . I have nothing to say that has n't already been expressed , so for now I 'll stick to commenting on other 's comments .... # 15 .... completly 100 % agree with you . # 27 HAHA ! you completly owned him ! JeepFu . I 'm not going to see ' The Love Guru ' because it looks like just a rehashing of old ' Austin Powers ' jokes . In my opinion , Mike Myers needs to reinvent himself and stop clinging onto the fame he got from Austin Powers . Or retire . But then Vern ( mini - me ) Troyer would be out of a job ... unless a new star wars movie was made and they needed Ewoks . Drew . Have people forgotten the Shrek movies ? Shrek came out in 2001 right before goldmember , then the Cat in the Hat , then Shrek 2 which made $ 441,226,247 which is number 3 in the all time Box Office . Shrek and Shrek 2 were great movies and while Shrek 3 was n't as good as the first two movies but still came in 18th in the all time box office list with $ 322,719,944 . Those two were his last two movie before the Love Guru So I do n't think Mike Myers is dwindling down , I just think he took a 5 minute sketch like Waynes World ( not comparing the two quality wise ) and made it into a movie . The difference is that Waynes World was funny enough to make a movie , the Love Guru was not ... . I 'm throwing in with the fat guy ! Fatty . When Myers did broad , fifth grade humor in \" Wayne 's World \" , people took it as a sharp satire on goofy , heavy - metal - obsessed suburban teenagers . When he did broad , fifth grade humor in \" Austin Powers \" , people took it as a sharp satire on the unsubtle , over - the - top innuendo of British spy films of the 60s . When he does broad , fifth grade humor in \" Love Guru \" , people realize that Myers was n't making fun of that sense of humor - that is his sense of humor . In that way , \" Guru \" is the rare movie that 's not only terrible , but makes you feel stupid for liking a performer 's earlier movies . Garrett.king . that 's weird , Fatty . I do n't feel stupid for enjoying his earlier films ... intriguing . Paul . he 's washed up lol .

To add to its misery , the appreciating audience for boobie and pee pee humor is not able to see it due PG-13 . Razzie award awaits . Although I must admit , I did laugh several times , most of this humor is silly , dumb , and frankly , not funny . Even though I did n't expect this movie to be good whatsoever ... I was still very disappointed . Do n't waste your money going to see it in theaters , wait till it comes out on DVD . The first movie is better by far . Short answer \" Grown Ups 2 \" complete waste of time ! It 's not the worst comedy movie of the year ( Scary Movie 5 reserved that title ) , but having that cast and delivering this dull , dumb , pointless picture . I thought the first movie was bad but leave it to Adam Sandler to once again out do himself in the god awful film department . The movie has no story to speak of and the plot was forgotten in a haze of bad bodily function jokes and Nick Swardson once again trying way to hard to be funny and failing at every turn .

The film sets up dozens of potential plotlines but most are forgotten about or quickly thrown back in to try and recover by giving it a poorly constructed resolution . To top it off , the jokes in the film are so painfully bad that it should come with a warning that expecting mothers should avoid the film and how it will destroy your ability to ever find joy in this world again . The worse part , Adam Sandler will make sure to be a part of something even worse in 2014 . ... Expand . Grown Ups ( The first one ) was quite a heart - warming film , about a group of childhood friends reuniting to bid their Basketball couch farewell , who seemed to have given all of them a sense of purpose and drive to continue their lives into adulthood . The second film , has none of the first movie 's seemingly moral stature . There does n't seem to be any apparent plot , and it merely follows the group of friends around their everyday existence in their neighborhood . This movie was a disappointment , and not worth paying money to watch at the cinema . Wait for dvd , even better , wait till your local broadcaster airs it , because technically it 's a bit embarrassing people would contribute to a million plus in box office sales , as it certainly is n't worth it . ...

Rather it is a series of fart joke skits edited together with one bad joke repeated through said fart skits . The first movie had some funny parts , this series of fart jokes edited together feels like a money grab . Very poorly written and directed . By far the worst Adam Sandler movie of all time , even worse than 50 first dates . This is an insult to movies . The first one was already awful , but the sequel is way more awful , with laughable acting and nonsense flat plot , that tries to make us laugh , buy it only make us want to walk out of the theatre before it finishes . OMG This sequel sucks SO BAD ! ! The first Grown Ups was bad enough . All of the storyline if there even is one , plot , characters , dialogue , jokes , etc , are just TERRIBLE ! ! ! Most of Adam Sandler 's recent movies ( except maybe Pixels ) are bad . Avoid this movie at all costs . OMG This is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen ! The jokes are n't even FUNNY ! ! ! ! ! The previous one was bad enough . This movie has crappy dialogue , storyline , etc . Avoid this movie AT ALL COSTS ! ! ! ! ! ! Buy Super Smash Bros. Brawl instead . This movie is awful and lazy , even by Adam Sandler standards . It 's just pretentious how bad his films are now because he knows people will pay to see any of his crap . People were laughing throughout this and look if you like Sandler movies then more power to you . Just know you 're sense of humor is n't too intelligent and Sandler thinks you 're an idiot . This movie was horrible on so many levels , from all the gay and pee jokes , to the objectifying of women and awful acting . This movie is not a comedy , it is a hot , steaming pile of crap ... which would be a WHOLE lot funnier than this nonsense .

This is a clever , entertaining video - game based movie . It 's also funny , touching , and I had a lot of fun with this film . What I would have liked to have seen more were characters based of from video games in reality . But other than that , this movie was just great . Best movie I saw in 2012 . As a game villain Ralph is tired of being treated poorly , so on a bet he make an attempt at getting a coveted hero 's medal . A story of trust and friendship , the video game landscape does n't hurt the movie at all . I did n't watch cartoons for a long time , but oh am I glad I got myself to watch this one . Mostly funny jokes , good soundtrack , LOTS of cameos and homages to different video game characters , and the absolutely adorable Vanellope all make up an extremely solid cartoon which you must not miss .

The saying \" Give people an inch , and they 'll ask for a mile \" applies here . People who expected this movie to be a modern - day \" Cartoon All - Stars \" were bound to be disappointed , as this movie was always meant to be a Disney film starring original characters flavored by familiar faces and locales .

It takes the world of arcade games and shows us the view of the bad guy , who may not be so bad after all . The creators of the game really know what makes Disney Animation the best in the business , because just like a Pixar film , they are able to touch the core in the kid in us and able to give even an adult like me a great time . My only complaint about this film is that although they have many video game characters and worlds , we mostly spend time in a game called Sugar Rush . It 's a candy world with a lot of characters that reminds me of Strawberry Shortcake or something , and I just felt like the movie could 've explored a lot more games than a candy world .

That keeps the attention on the main characters without forcing pop - culture references . The worlds were beautifully well done , even the Fix - It Felix world which was only a penthouse and garbage dump in front of a black backdrop . I wanted to know what would happen to each of the main characters , and each of them received a very fitting ending . The twist at the end was barely predictable ( at least for myself and the people I went to go see it with ) and , as it is Disney , I was left crying at the appropriate moments . Even the soundtrack was wonderful , I purchased it shortly after seeing the film . This is a rare movie for me in the case that I put in money and effort to see it multiple times .

The characters are good , the main character has reasonable reasons for doing what he 's done , the supporting cast are fun . Some have the cute brat charm , while others have the army general type . Story is great too , talking about how it feels to be the bad guy ; of course it 's circumstantial , but it does get the point across and the main character shows very good development . This is one of my favorite Disney films , and it surprises me in how this was n't a Pixar production . I guess there 's this giant plot hole near the end , but I do n't see it as a major problem . I believe this is one of the best Disney films out there , and is certainly a joy to watch . ... Collapse . A great animation of the Disney studios .

Wreck - It Ralph firmly latches on to this sentiment , providing the older members of the audience with just as much to enjoy as the kids . Disney 's business practices are n't always seen in a positive light , but there can be no argument as to the consistency of the films they put out . They have a knack for producing stories that live long in the memory of both children and adults alike . This particular movie is no exception and , whilst the plot is far from original in terms of its themes and morals , it 's done with such heart that it really does n't matter . There are lazy genre flicks , but there are also good genre flicks , and this certainly falls into the latter category . The world itself is realised with great attention to detail . The bright colours and finely detailed environments giving a real sense of how much work has gone into the production . The sights and sounds of the arcade are also integrated into the action with great effect , the mindful application they receive giving the impression that it 's not just the audience that has been hit with a dose of nostalgia . As per usual for Disney , the voice acting is top notch , with stars as diverse as Jane Lynch and Dennis Haysbert lending their expertise to bring the world to life . The characters are also very well conceived , each with their own cross to bear as they live out their lives as jobbing sprites in the local arcade . The art of tempering cuteness with a degree of sadness is where the film really excels , never coming close to the point of being off - putting through being sickly sweetness . Rounding out the characters is a huge cast of extras taken from a variety of retro gaming sources . From a marketing perspective , it 's a masterstroke . The kids get their serving of fun , but the appeal extends to a whole different generation , drawn in by the promise of a trip down memory lane . ... Expand .

Wreck - it Ralph is one of the most original , sweet , and funny Disney movies to come out in years . Everything in the movie is colorful and dazzling , and it takes you back to the retro era of video gaming . It 's message and heart are the best parts about it . Wreck it Ralph is one of the greatest animated movies that is thrilling , hilarious , creative , and full of emotions . Audiences can understand Ralph 's perspective of feeling like a \" nobody . \" The story line flows very well and is great for children of all ages .

Wreck it Ralph is one of the greatest animated movies that is thrilling , hilarious , creative , and full of emotions . Audiences can understand Ralph 's perspective of feeling like a \" nobody . \" The story line flows very well and is great for children of all ages . The movie is about a game character who struggles to become a hero by obtaining a medal . Ralph strives to become a hero by surviving in another game called \" Hero 's Duty . \" Although he won the medal , he accidentally brings a \" cy - bug \" with him which can jeopardize the whole game system . Ralph and Vanellope have explored Candy Land adventures and met an enemy called \" King Candy \" which then gives a great twist to the story . In my perspective , Wreck it Ralph does not need any improvements since it effectively presents a successful story of Ralph finding his own true meaning of himself and is seen as a hero all along . I think the director of this movie did a wonderful job in creating each scene and making sure it flows smoothly until the very end . Overall , the movie is thrilling and did not fail to entertain the audience and myself . Literary : The spoken language is completely English and each of the main characters changes through out the film by further exploring their inner personality . The main issue of the movie is that Ralph fails to become a hero since he is always the \" bad guy . \" Ralph 's situation with the cy - bug caused more problems and have jeopardized the game system . The story was very interesting to me since the plot was well developed and characters had very unique personalities . Dramatic : The setting of this movie was very extraordinary . All the features in \" Candy Land \" were made out of candy and most of these candies were from Willy Wonka Company . The colorful backgrounds and scenery were very impressive and creative . Cinematic : In several scenes of the movie , the music flowed very well with the action of the characters . I believe the music is appropriate and fits well with the scenarios . The music is fun , playful , and great for children . ... Expand . This is one of the greatest animated movies that I have ever seen . I would say that it is amazing to a level par to Toy Story .

Let me tell you : I am not a fan of Disney movies at all , but this one right here , is one that just ca n't be ignored . Wreck It Ralph is one of the most cleverly written and created films ever made by Disney , possibly even further than just Disney . i love wreck it ralph its everything i seen in an animated film but not like this . there should be more violent but still loved it . but sugar rush is for gay girls and boys which i hated in this film . The concept and animation is just brilliant . Although the constant cameos and popular references , the occasional over - use of wordplay and a slight lack of emotional connection drag it down slightly , especially when compared to other recent Disney entries , it 's still a great family film .

I do agree with a lot of people with the whole fact that this movie may have spent a little too much time in the Sugar Rush game ; I would 've liked it if they would 've just explored other different games . Of course I understand that Disney could n't just pull references out in every nook in cranny probably due to the copyrighting section of their budget . But I love what this films offers , I think that anyone could enjoy this game even if you are not a gamer .

The fact the movie centres around 3 main game worlds shows how much they have thought about it . Wreck it ralph is kind of neutral ground , Heroes duty is aimed more at the male population and then of course Sugar Rush is aimed more at the female population .

I also like the way the use video games in the film , to also have a game feel in the movie . One of Disney 's greatest movies of all time to me . It has everything you would ever want in a film . Well done , Disney . \" One of the most original films in years \" indeed ! I loved every bit of creativity that Disney has placed into this wholly beautiful and charming film , especially with the puns involved ( Nesquik sand , LOL ) ! What a movie , I mean it 's fantastic , so original . Who could come up with such a great idea . I love the charters , and the voice acting was great .

' Wreck - It Ralph ' is one of those rare original movies from Walt Disney Animation Studios , in other words , it 's not based on fairy - tales , it 's not based on true stories or anything else for that matter . It 's just an idea that came from a writer 's head and sold it to whatever studio is willing to accept it . It 's just an idea that came from a writer 's head and sold it to whatever studio is willing to accept it . Whenever the arcade closes , the video game characters go on to their daily lives of going to bars , or just hanging out at another game program . Ca n't blame him , when was the last time you played \" Super Mario \" and thought maybe you should give Bowser a break ? Why would you ? He keeps kidnapping the Princess . Ralph decides that enough is enough and must earn everybody 's respect the same way that the ever so popular Felix Jr. ( Jack McBrayer ) has earned everybody 's respect . In order for Ralph to prove himself , he needs to win a medal and it is there that he will get what he desires . He tries to do this by \" game - hopping \" , in other words , one video game character entering a different video game , kind of like seeing Sonic the Hedgehog appear out of nowhere in the game \" Luigi 's Mansion \" . Ralph enters a game called \" Hero 's Duty \" , a homage to the ever so popular \" Call of Duty \" . He meets a very ballsy female action hero called Sargent Calhoun ( Jane Lynch ) , who is a very funny character as she takes no nonsense and has more guts than most men , including Ralph . Ralph manages to receive the medal , but accidentally takes a ship and a harmful \" Hero 's Duty \" bug into another game called \" Sugar Rush \" which combines the visual aspect of \" Candy Crush \" and the gameplay style of \" Mario Kart \" . He meets a young girl named Vanellope Von Schweetz ( Sarah Silverman ) who takes his medal and uses it to enter the race that she can not be a part of . We also meet a mysterious leader named King Candy ( Alan Tudyk ) , who does not want Vanellope to compete in the game and tries to stop Ralph from letting her do so . The funniest parts in the movie include the surprising romance between Fix - It Felix Jr. and Sargent Calhoun , the way the writers pull that off with intentional cliches , but genuine chemistry is very well done .

Felix is kind hearted and cares for those around him , even if they are villains in their respectful games . Calhoun is programmed to have a tragic back story that scars her for life but overcomes the problem . Vanellope being left out all because she 's a glitch but in reality , that 's a cover up ; she 's really trustful and can make good jokes for laughs . The movie truly deserves a sequel that features more game jumping , more game characters and more screen time for most of the characters like Candlehead and Mario ( despite not appearing in the movie but has a reference ) . ...

I loved Austin Powers : International Man of Mystery . In fact , let 's stick with present tense . I still love it . It was stupid , bold , at times clever and almost always original . Sure , it was n't ( and still is n't ) a classic comedy for the ages , but it was innocent , inane fun for Americans in the happy - go - lucky late 90 's . Mike Myers had n't been heard from in four years leading up to it , which was bizarre since we 'd all grown so close to him on SNL . After Wayne 's World and Wayne 's World 2 ( speaking of which - whatever happened to Dana Carvey ? ) , Myers went from the indie favorite So I Married an Ax Murderer in 1993 to the international favorite Austin Powers in 1997 . The next year , he played his most impressive role to date as Steve Rubell in the now all - but - forgotten 54 , and it appeared , at least for a short period , that Mike Myers was on the way to a long and diverse career . Shrek was a fun animated film and , dare I say , it even deserved to win the first ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature over its Pixar - produced competition , Monsters , Inc . Fine . But Shrek 2 , Shrek the Third , now Shrek Goes Fourth ( and who knows how many more ) ? Turns out that in the last 11 years , Mike Myers has had only two leading live - action film roles : Austin Powers and The Cat in the Hat . How is that possible ? I remember reading this New York Times article ( \" Mike Myers : Intentional Man of Mystery \" ) a year and a half ago , which proved that I was n't the only one wondering where Myers was . The article suggested that he was uber - picky about choosing roles but mentioned that a \" comedy about a relationship guru \" was one of the projects Myers had been working on . This , we now know , was The Love Guru , opening next Friday . Myers ' agent in the article : \" He 's a love guru . He 's somebody who 's become an expert on relationships . That 's what leads me to think that if it works , it can be a franchise . The guru can be thrust into all kinds of situations in that regard . \" Sigh . Another franchise , huh ? Mike , some advice : ditch your agent . The guru is near and dear to your heart and you have an incredible marketing push behind it . I get that . But seriously , something 's not clicking with The Love Guru . Ben Kingsley 's appearance in The Love Guru trailer briefly piqued my interest , but if I want to see him in a movie this summer , I 'll watch him in The Wackness . But seriously , Mike - you realize you have a lot more potential than all of this ... right ? We just have n't seen it fulfilled in over a decade . 21 comments : . I do n't know what happened to Mike Myers ' career , but I do know that Dana Carvey almost died and has had continuing health problems . \" In 1997 , he underwent open - heart surgery for a blocked artery . Unfortunately , the doctors operated on the wrong artery . Carvey later sued for medical malpractice and was awarded $ 7.5 million . He has had to undergo a total of five medical procedures ( four angioplasties and one surgery ) to correct his heart problems . Carvey stated in an interview with Larry King that he donated all the money awarded to him from the lawsuit to charity . In 2002 , he returned to the silver screen in the comedy Master of Disguise , which was panned by critics but managed about $ 40 million at the North American box office . A very private person , Carvey withdrew from the limelight to focus on his family . He later said in an interview that he does n't want to be in a career in which his kids would already be grown with him having neglected time with them . \" ( Wikipedia ) . The first AP is too funny for words , but I wanted to slit my wrists during the next two . The first Shrek was enjoyable enough , but not enough to warrant me spending money or , more importantly , time to check out the other two . And \" Cat in the Hat\"-WTF ? I miss 90s Mike . Maybe he just does n't fit into this new world , that seems even more dumbed down than it used to be , so he agrees to \" Love Guru \" for the paycheck . Well at least he does n't have 3 movies like that coming out every year like Will Ferrell . There 's always an upside . I 'm wondering the same thing , and I 'm glad you mentioned his performance in \" 54 . \" He showed some promise of being a seriously good actor in that film , and that promise has never been fulfilled . \" The Love Guru \" looks godawful to me . Ah , I 'm at a conference all day and come back to find my question validated . I thought somebody might call me out for questioning a career that 's actually not over in any definitive sense . I just think The Love Guru is n't necessarily the best way to come back to the live - action world . Right , I did find that out recently , Marilyn . Carvey was a pretty talented sketch character , and I believe he was somewhat coaxed into doing Master of Disguise to show people he was OK . Too bad it was mostly forgotten . I guess he 's coming back with a TV show , now ... . Rachel , in my opinion the Shrek movies lose their flavor and freshness with each new installment . The second and third ones had different writers than the first , and now the fourth will have an even different scribe ( Myers has n't written any of them ) . Anyway , what concerns me is that Myers did n't just \" agree \" do to Guru , but he 's actually been working on it for years ( according to that article ) . This is his big personal project . We 'll see what happens in terms of sequels . Fletch , wow , Phil Hartman - moment of silence , please ... thank you ... . \" It just seems tired . \" You mean exploiting Verne Troyer again , Nayana ? Or Myers doing sex jokes with a weird accent ? Or the ridiculous pop star cameos ( Beyonce in Goldmember , Timberlake in Guru ) ? I know , and I agree , Matthew , that Guru just looks like a disappointment from start to finish . Pat , how and why he followed up 54 with Pete 's Meteor ( I 'd never heard of it ) is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the 90 's . I ca n't even really put my finger on it , but yeah , it sounds like I 'm in line with just about everyone here . I still would argue that the first Austin Powers is one of the 90 's pure comedy classics . It 's quite witty and actually has something to say about the cultural divide . I think AP 's final confrontation with Dr. Evil is rather poignant . And there 's no shit jokes as in the awful sequels . I seroiusly thought Myers could be a new Woody Allen , or art least Peter Sellers , but he seems to choose the low road every time . SPROCKETS ! ! How about the \" Simon \" sketches ? Actually , I 'm surprised a \" Coffee Talk \" movie never happened - or a Wayne 's World 3 , for that matter . Guess it was before EVERY MOVIE HAS TO HAVE MULTIPLE SEQUELS . Despite what sounds like a full - on boycott of Guru , Craig , I still will give him the benefit of the doubt for future roles . The guy can be funny - if he 's serious about being funny ... . It 's fair to say he was pretty traumatized by the sickness and death of his father back whenever that happened . Perhaps he 'll bounce back . I 'm not as big on Austin Powers as most people , though I liked it . As I just finished saying elsewhere , I liked OSS 117 better because it was period and the character took himself completely seriously . Though I have n't seen it in a million years , I think Wayne 's World is my favorite Myers movie and one of the few successful examples of an SNL sketch making a movie that did n't suck . On the other hand , yeah , a Sprockets movie just might make me feel like a little gurrrrl . It 's so tempting to compare OSS and Austin Powers , but they really have their own territory . OSS is a lot nicer to look at , and as you say , it tries a lot hard to stay serious / and or true to the original formula . Austin Powers is like an SNL sketch , and Myers does n't really disappear into the role or anything . Speaking of sketches , it 's true that Wayne 's World was a lot better than Night at the Roxbury or Superstar , for example . I ca n't believe we were THAT close to a Sprockets movie . We might have missed the cultural window for that one , but I 'd still show up . I love MM , but I do n't think we 'll ever get the 90 's guy back . Just like I think that Sandler is off his rocker for making some of the crap he has made lately . But at least we have Wayne 's World , Austin Powers 1 , Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore to cherish forever ! Dana Carvey is back doing stand up now , and I believe he has a special that has either already aired on HBO , or will air soon . As for Myers , I think he got trapped in a rut . Convinced that only he can write for himself , and that he must somehow repeat the groovy fun of the first Austin Powers movie , but without the work necessary to do it . That 's why all you see in the Love Guru are cheap jokes about knocking around Vern Troyer , low - brow gags , and that stupid \" change purse \" line said by Stephen Colbert in all the ads . Well put , Furious D , and thanks for stopping by . I 'm glad for Dana Carvey - especially coming out of health problems , hopefully his career can see a resurgence . Regarding Myers , yes , I agree that Guru appears to be lazy writing . It 's just odd that he apparently sat on this character for years . Like he 's been grooming and preparing it , and yet it looks like he just came up with it yesterday . Well , I have n't seen Guru , but I have yet to hear anything positive about it ... . Entertainment Weekly 's recent article on Myers blames his absence from mainstream Hollywood on one person : Myers , himself . According to all the people interviewed , Myers is incredibly hard to work with because he insists on having everything his way . The article said that this goes back all the way to Axe Murderer , which I 'll agree with everyone here , and say it 's one of his best films . Side note , my friend recently saw Dana Carvey doing stand - up in San Jose , CA . Said he was really , really funny . I did n't know about the health problems but I hope he 's doing better . Aha , so some more truthiness comes out . It 's not hard to believe that he 's controlling , but that still does n't explain why he ca n't write good comedy anymore . Unless he 's just hard - headed and wo n't listen when someone tells him that a movie about a love guru is a ridiculous idea . I have n't watched the episode yet but I 'm really hoping for a bad review of Battleship , it looks all kinds of Michael Bayish . The video description says : \" Battleship starring Johnny Depp and Dark Shadows starring Rihanna . \" Lol . Can you put this up on the RSS feed ? I ca n't download it if you do n't . PraoMeta .

Sure , he created the story ( though not the final script it should be noted ) , but the director was Henry Selick ( who went on to make \" Coraline \" which has absolutely no Tim Burton connection whatsoever ) . That scream at the beginning of the clips had me rolling . mtr4216 . I am currently playing . Trentonmarbon . Wow . Ads during the show now ? Space Cop better be the greatest movie ever , you fucking pricks . Shureshot24 . Explosions ! ! ! ! Crosko23 . Rongkai . I could nt enjoy Battleship . The only \" dumb until it was funny \" part is the veteran scenes and watching them try to act , it had me laughing like a maniac . Not worth enduring the other agonising 2 and half hours . Just watch a clip on youtube or something . Guest . The devil 's in the details as they say . Also , if you ca n't understand the difference between the execution of The Avengers and the execution of Battleship , then you should probably stop watching movies all together . ann rain . Yeah , Crosko23 is a dumb ass ! ann rain . lolz . ann rain . NAH is such a dumbass ! ! ! ann rain . You watch the Big Bang Theory so you know must know a lot about dumb crap . Frackenshlacken . Hey subject 603-IDIOT , a sell out is someone who sacrifices their artistic integrity for money and fame . This is two fucking commercials on a free web video , surely more than enough time for you to jerk it to a picture of a 40 year old woman in pajamas in the online Sears catalog . Leicabot . I see that you guys mirrored your shot @ 0:24s . :) . Mid video ads ... I am so close to abandoning RLM ... . Guest . Explosions ! Guest . So Dark Shadows does nt ' go anywhere and is a product ? And what about the Avengers ? Is it an art film , full of consequences ? I say both films are products , but Dark Shadows , although clumsy from a more bureocratic point of view , at least has a thread to follow , one that I could n't find in The Avengers . Do n't get me wrong . I 'd like to know why your parameters change from film to film , and something that is pointed out as a mistake in one movie is not a mistake in another movie . Huuummmm ... is it because you like one of them and are biased against the other ? I can see you 're biased against Tim Burton , very clearly . Guest . I think the magic word here is \" works \" . You can get away with anything in a movie as long as it \" works \" . For example The Avengers does n't need a complex plot , but in a family drama / comedy it might be needed . Of course this differs from person to person and what they look for in a movie . Their standards do n't change and you can see kind of what things they look for , but they judge a movie on his own terms . DanceK . I have to hand it to you , Jay . Your acting has improved enormously since the first Half in the Bag . S G . It 's about expectations / potential . Avengers is a popcorn - flick by design . After all : it 's based on a comic book that features a flying man in a metal - suit and a norse god with a secret human identity and a winged helmet . You do n't expect anything deep or revolutionary there ( expect in the FX - department ) . But : I 'd expect a bit more from the pairing of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp . I may be expecting too much , but I 'd say Ed Wood should be the yardstick of what these guys can achieve when they 're collaborating . As far as bias against Tim Burton goes : Why is it bias to point out that you have n't liked any of his movies in ages ? While I do n't agree completely ( I really like Sleepy Hollow for instance ) , I do think they 're right about that tendency : He really has made a habit out of taking existing material and turning it into a \" Tim Burton - looking \" film . You know : Throw in Johnny Depp , Helena , some stripy socks and pale make - up , and you 're done . Kinda like what he did with Ed Wood . David Martin . This is the best and funniest fucking show on the internet . Still not a single bad episode ! David Martin . Perish the thought you have to watch an ad break ! What the fuck is it with people and their grossly swollen sense of entitlement . The show is free and top - quality entertainment , fuck off and stop watching then , no one needs you lol . Guest . Have you already abandoned ever watching television or listening to the radio ? You do realize that ads are what allow people to continue to afford to create the content you enjoy , right ? Have fun working at Taco Bell . Guest . Did you really end that paragraph saying \" is it because you like one of them ? \" Gee , yeah I wonder if they gave a movie a positive review because they liked it . You 're a fucking idiot . Boo . I hope Mike and Jay do n't actually read all the comments posted here . Most of the people that leave them appear to be morons lol . M_grieve . You guys forgot about Edward Scissorhands , my second favorite TB movie outside of Ed Wood . Original , dark , gothic , funny but with a very serene sadness at it 's core . I love that movie ... . MatthewMelange . Oh , you guys did n't have the \" directed by \" part of your credits . Guest . Well , your opinion is that , your opinion . I can not tell you if you re right or wrong . my feelings are this though . as a audience member for the show HITB , I feel let down because you broke your precedence for movies like these . As a audience member I have come to expect your opinions to be X and then enjoy how you explain X but in this review you went with Y. . Like I said before your experience , opinions are of course your own , I was taken aback by how you had praise for a certain type of movie . Are you now getting paid by the studios ? Guest . You know they 're just a couple of guys talking about movies on the internet right ? If their thoughts on a movie shatters your worldview , then you must have a pretty empty life . Guest . never once did i allude to my world view being shattered . i guess i used to many big words and ideals for you to get the message clearly . so ill dumb it down . Mike and Jay have opinions . I have opinions . Mike and Jay have expectations for movies . I have expectations for movies . Mike and Jay get let down by movies . I get let down by movies . To further help you out , . \" You know they 're just a couple of guys talking about movies on the internet right ? \" Thank you for pointing that out , I missed that fact . Since you so elegantly pointed that out , then this becomes a show , a piece of entertainment , much like a movie . so ill help you out again , . Mike and Jay have opinions . I have opinions . Mike and Jay have expectations for movies . I have expectations for movies . Mike and Jay get let down by movies . I get let down by movies . but your right , my world view is completely ruined , i just read USA today , there apparently is a war in the middle east . When did this happen ? Did you ever hear of a place called Vietnam ? My dad said he went there and got in a fight with a guy named charlie . I had soup from Vietnam one time , it was called pho , it was so good I could never imagine a military superpower fighting in a country that makes such good soup ! Oh god ! I just saw the film called Loose Change ! did you know that New York got attacked , oh my ! ! My world view ! what happened to it ? ? ? ? Oh god , my perceptions ! Fading ! Waiiiiit there is more ! there is this thing called the internet , where people honor and respect others opinions . Waiiiit the only opinion that matters is yours , and you must show how you re dominant over every one else . Oh my world view ! come back to me ! ! ! My life is so empty ! ! Si7i . dear god what the fuck are you talking about ? ? ? take your meds . Bigbang . TL;DR . Boo . They found things to like in a movie that you did n't . So fucking what ? FuckYouMatthew . A 30-minute episode for the price of two 15 - 30 second ads . Unless it is n't a stick that 's up your ass and you have an asshole the size of your head . Just be thankful you have access to the internet and a meal on your table and leave the complaining up to people who actually have real problems ... Bitch . Hi there , Mike ! Hi there , Jake ! This is the first time I leave a comment here , and I 'd like to say , first of all , that I really enjoy your video reviews . Talking about this particular episode , I really liked Dark Shadows , ( I 'm not blind to its flaws , though ) and I had a feeling you guys would n't like it . This part of the review was n't as funny as the one on Battleship , but it was just as interesting . Do you guys have any plan of reviewing a Brazilian film ? I ask you because I am Brazilian . Have you ever seen a film from my country ? We have some great ones and some unbelievably terrible ones that I 'm sure you 'd love ! Well , got ta go . Keep up the great work ! Tiptoed around the \" Am I perverted for thinking Chloe Moretz is hot ? \" thing . btw she is . Sorry ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Hi , JAY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Where the hell did I take JAKE from ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Somebody is fucking with my medication ! ! ! ! ! ! wtf bro why 2 advertisement for 1 video ! Within Reason . Oh , shut up . Urtiga . The good or bad criticism , during the show are not an mandatory order , it is not \" Execute the Half in the Bag 66 \" stop watching every movie because they did not like . I 'm sure they do not receive money from the studios , by the way , the visceral type of criticism here , it hardly applies for example , in the course of journalism . If you focus on the entertainment industry as a way of life , without starving . Battleship is horrible , I agree with the sarcasm and criticism completely . It seems that the Lucas Films , the effects division ( ILM ) , only recycle the effects of Transformers and Red Tails , and sell to the director of Battleship . Regarding about Tim Burton , someone had a chance to see the book , dvd , from the movie \" Alice in Wonderland \" here ? an expensive book , with pendrive in form of a key , large photos . is like the box of the game Diablo 3 , with book , dvd , pendrive in form of a crystal , the head of Diablo ... in short , cash ! Tim Burton today , is about make things visually nice for consumption , profitable to the next line of action figures , books , etc .. Over the past 10 years he has not released a new vision . Today is the consumer way , everything for create a more profitable product . The movie sux ? well , the videogame is awesome , etc . . Fat Homo Room Trashing . Why would aliens send more ships if the first ones never even contacted them after coming to Earth ? They would think the first wave got crushed and stay away . \" Pee Wee 's Big Adventure \" is a great movie that makes mw Phil Hartman , who co - wrote it . Fat Homo Room Trashing . mw meant \" me miss \" . mw the right keys . Dravinian . Can I just say , adverts in the middle of it .... that is annoying , and it have an impact on my returning to the site . I love you guys , but I hate being irritated even more . You whine on about the irritating factor of the Transformers movies , but fail to realise that your own site is recreating that exact feeling in your fan base ? Adverts yes , adverts that interrupt that review ... no . Suspiro . Google Chrome + AdBlock - no ads here . benjamin . i want one of those head devices . benjamin . good show as always guys . guest . oh relax . They put out a product you enjoy and they are trying to get funding for a project . Is sitting through an extra 30 seconds really that off - putting for you ? Guest . yes , yes it is . Sheik Yerbouti . The only reason people did n't like Dark Shadows is because they 're probably too young to remember the soap opera and were upset that Barnabas did n't sparkle . I thought the HITB review was spot on . Great characters , great visuals , great performances , silly and rather convoluted story ( like any good soap opera ) . I have not seen Battleship yet . KHMac . You do n't have to get into the science of it to explain why the film Battleship is ridiculous . How about that the US Navy has n't had active battleships in their navy for over 20 years . ann rain . Just download it with a stream download program . There are plenty free ones on the web , just search download youtube videos and they work for the stream site HITB uses . I started doing this because the videos do n't load properly for me from blip . ann rain . Dude has schizophrenia me thinks . \" Less painful than you expect ! \" is singlehandedly the best review quote I 've ever seen poorly photoshopped onto a poster ... ever . Guest . Then you should probably stop watching any media in any format . Or grow up . Guest . ad blocker plus , it works for me . Guest . ^ha , they did n't get it ! Guest . Whining about free video reviews . I bet you do n't even donate to their site . I 'm going to go out on a limb and say that the battleship was NOT named after Led Zeppelin 's bassist . \" So I 'm fighting with my insurance company to get breast reduction surgery , but they wo n't do it because I 'm not a lady . Well shit , I got bigger tits than Miley Ray Cyrus and I seen hers on an Internet porno site \" -Mike . Guest . I like how they enter through a glass door hinged on their right hand that turns into a solid door that 's hinged on their left . Dvweb . You know if you play what plinkett says I the opening backwards it says what his next review will be . Mr Bubbles . I 'm not gon na lie , I was expecting a reference to the next Plinkett review at the end . dickturd . a couple of beguiling movies . Bronilex . I love all this- but remember next time you question the logic of casting and production , you have a faux plinket when the real guy is there ! ! Guest . You 're an idiot . Gregg . \" Battleship starring Johnny Depp \" . \" Dark Shadows starring Rihanna . \" I was n't really expecting it , but now that you mentioned , Mr. Bubbles , that would have been GREAT ! So the last giant alien ship was shot to pieces and the bubble shield collapsed . Seeing that opening , the Admiral immediately ordered for every plane on the carrier to be launched into the fray . OK , nothing weird about that ... except . He was on the flight deck and shouting those orders on a noisy place with no one near him . Should n't he be on the bridge or the CIS if he wanted to give that order quickly to everyone ? What business does he has to be on the flight deck anyway ? KC1287 . Although I agree with most of the review , I wholeheartedly disagree with the way you criticize the real life veterans in the movie . They were cast as a tribute to American Veterans who have sacrificed much for this country , including your right to provide a critique . You should put on a uniform and make a meaningful sacrifice for this nation that has provided for you and your family a way of life unlike any other country could . Guest . They 're not making fun of vets , they 're making fun of bad acting . Should they never mention if a female gives a bad performance because that would be considered sexist ? Robby . Yes , he is . Lort . Criticizing women is part of our way of life , even though without them we would n't have one . Guest . are you Grandpa Simpson . AstralWang . I know ! It totally ruined the immersion ! Guest . No , that 's not how it works . If we killed a bunch of their fellow aliens , the likely large amount of surviving aliens would n't just say \" Oh well , guess we 're just gon na forget about all that . \" That 's really stupid . Guest . Because it 's a huge video . Typical Youtube videos come with a 15 - 30 second advertisement than maybe four minutes of video ( and they buffer much slower there ) . Typical good videos , that is . There are plenty of shitty ones that come without ads . Desert . What morons liked this comment ? \" Waiiiiit there is more ! there is this thing called the internet , where people honor and respect others opinions . \" Are you insane ? \" ... where people honor and respect others opinions . \" No they do n't . That 's the dumbest thing in your entire post . By the way , you still did n't explain why you were disappointed in their opinion . I 'm just guessing you were mad they praised Battleship for being funny and recommending it despite it being awful . They made it pretty clear that it was a dumb action movie , and that you should only see it if you really want action or if you want to laugh at the awful script . Guest . No . There 's an excess of that shit . I enjoyed the early episodes as well , but the less strife and depression I have to deal with in a comical internet review show , the better . The Nightmare Before Christmas is n't a Tim Burton movie . It 's a Henrick Selick Film . Tim Burton wrote the original poem it was based on and did some character design . Represent motherfuckers ! He actually says \" Hey , do n't you got anything better to do ? \" That 's right . I went through the trouble of actually reversing the audio . Was really disappointed there were no clues about the next Plinkett review . I saw Dark Shadows with my family , and one thing I can say was that it was definitely not a 12a . There were two sex scenes and a fair bit of blood , and theoretically a child of any age could go and see this film . The teenieboppers surrounding us certainly could n't handle it , going into fits of giggles whenever anything vaguely sexual came up , as well as talking throughout , whooping and hollering and farting . The film was 5 years of TV show compressed into 2 hours of film , and it shows . Plot threads came up for ten minutes then hid quietly away again - the Barnabas / Nanny love angle got all of what , two scenes to develop ? The whole porcelain witch thing got no explanation , and that ridiculous plot point with the daughter right at the very end was just abysmal , almost as much as Alice Cooper 's appearance . Depp 's performance ( and neckwear ) was by far the best aspect of this film , though I preferred his brief appearance in 21 Jump Street . What was really strange , though , and perhaps this was because we arrived late and had to sit on some bean bags at the front of the seats , straining our necks , was the first shot of the Collins daughter . The low angle and skirt combined to create a very voyeuristic feeling - I felt like a paparazzo for ' Kid - Fuckers Weekly ' , trying to get an upskirt shot of a girl stepping out of a Fisher Price car . Kang . You do n't mention that the aliens in question are hostile invaders looking to conquer our planet . They probably do n't place much value on life , and seem like the sort that respect brute force over diplomacy . This is because they 're special effects passed off as characters , with no depth . You know . Stupid . You guys are getting soft . Come on and hate on a movie already . \" The only people I can see hating this movie are like , I dunno , movie snobs ? \" Brilliant . They 're still shitty actors . That was their point . GuyintheHat . I do n't mean to defend the movie , but that 's why the vets are the ones that man the only functional Battleship at the end of the film . Still stupid but at least the film acknowledges the fact that the Battleship has been out of service . Bj12 . You 're mis - quoting . He 's talking about the type of audience these types of movies appeal to , not who will like this specific one . That 's a big difference . Also , I find it a breath of fresh air that they are n't just filled with hate and anger for every movie . There 's way too much of that negativity online . Kittywuvhcn . You stupid bitch . Its not the paying tribute that is wrong , its the way they go about it . The film makers created such a disastrous scene it made the veterans look like assholes . If anything the film makers should be blamed . If i offered to pay tribute to your dead grandma during her funeral by hiring a gay clown to go piss on her corpse would that be ok because i was just trying to \" pay tribute \" ? I think Mike and Jay summed up Tim Burton 's movie career since he started doing only remakes perfectly . Although I think Big Fish was original ? Or was it based off of something ? Regardless , his remakes are basically just him putting his Burton visual style into it , without them having any other substance to hold them up as a solid film . For instance , I had such high hopes for Alice in Wonderland since it was a story I loved so much as a kid , and I thought maybe , just maybe Tim Burton could redeem himself and make it a good film , but nope . Huge disappointment . It 's a shame because some of my favorite films from the 90s are Burton films . It will be interesting to see if his next film , Frankenweenie , a stop motion film , based off of Frankenweenie , a live action short Burton did in 84 . SO yes , another remake , but maybe it 'll be good ... . i want to know the name of that website he was looking at . Guest . Someone should go through the trouble of producing the poster and stealthily swapping it for the official one at a movie theater . Jay 's dialogue and opinions are getting better every week ! aisbauer . Actually , this is the only webzone where I 'm not using AdBlock . ILM - Irrational Labor Machine . People say - lack of respect with the veterans in the review ? no way ! The real lack of respect with the veterans , is invites them to act in a movie , just making video game shit ... i think Battleship is the worst movie of 2012 . In resume , Avatar is a grotesque caricature of the modern military , Battleship a caricature more dumb . Fuck ... how much time with stupid movies ? is not more a decade with some shit , and good stuff , now i think is a millenium of garbage . my favorite directors start recycle her own stuff , to relaunch as \" new \" . This torment never ends . Was n't the TV series in the late sixties ? So , you 'd be pushing 60 yourself to remember the show ? Waaait ... these guys are trying to pay their bills ? ! Those scum bags ! Boo . Jesus Christ I hate fucking entitled idiots like you . I know you think you 're clever for pointing out some sort of hypocrisy in their use of advertising , but you have no clue what you 're talking about . How is having an advertisement in the middle of their video the same as horrible out - of - place product placement in a film ? I guess you never watch television or listen to the radio either , right ? Why should the people who create content you admit to loving be allowed to make money so they can afford to create MORE content for you ? You 're an idiot . Guest . go home you nazi , people in uniform are murderers and rapist especially WW2 soldiers ... . Eagle . Why do you hate the troops ? \" The trouble \" ? Took me two minutes . Ricky . Yeeeeeaaaahhhh SPLOSIONS be fun . LooKed LIKE the Typical Run of the Mill ' darK ComedY about A moRticiaN ' and ! You missed my point , BJ , though I am happy that a literate person responded to me . I think that what made them amazing in the first place is the stringent criticism they had ; Mike Stoklasa giving a \" See - it ! \" review to a piece - of - shit schlockfest like Battleship ? cajaquarius . I like how the two guys hide in a room that has a garage type door that , according to the scene before it , was facing an alley too small to make use of it . I 've also cried myself on Battleship . The scene with veterans walking towards camera in slow motion is just hilarious . Sharktopus ! They also open a glass door and close a metal one . \" It 's a kind of magic . \" - Highlander . Guest . Yeah mang , why people got ta hate on dem vets mang . Dey da shit . Dis country ai nt free , if you want to have an opinion , go somewhere else you hataz . Kyle_delaney . Does anyone know what Plinkett was saying backwards at the beginning ? It sounded like the last word was \" Ya \" meaning forwards the first word would be \" I \" . Jacques . Get a life . -Your mom . Luke . Mike and Jay 's IQ levels were lowered 50 points when they put on the helmets and received the Battleship and Dark Shadows transmission . Hold on . You professional film reviewer guys think \" The Brady Bunch \" was bigger than \" Dark Shadows \" in its time ? Homework people , homework . In terms of intellectual weight , the former barely registered on the culture and the only reason a remake of \" The Brady Bunch \" might earn more than this film is because it fit a more low brow aesthetic . Than again , Twilight was a low brow politically correct remake of Dark Shadows . Why would professional film reviewers not take the time to watch a few episodes of the original series and 1970 spinoff movie on Netflix ? I do n't get that . And \" based on some gd soap opera \" ? You got ta be kidding . Boys , including Depp , would run home from school and watch this with their baseball bats and gloves before going out to play ball . This Depp movie was non - stop Inside Jokes . You really had to be familiar with the gist of the original material to get a lot of it and there 's nothing wrong with that . It made the movie better . You probably did n't get why the girl on the train said \" My name is Maggie Evans ... I mean Victoria , Victoria Winters \" . That 's because the actresses in the soaps kept getting preggers and quitting . The series was all over the place and made up as it went along . They did n't have tape editing back then so bloopers were shown as if it was a live performance ... which made the story seem that much more real . Angelique was invented in episode 368 ( after viewers would have watched 134 hours of the show ) . And between Marsha Brady and Angelique , no contest for male viewers . That witch had men mesmerized and still does . Are you serious ? That sequence was alone worth the price of 3 admission tickets as I saw it in 3 languages . Of course , you had to appreciate the way the Carpenters once dominated the charts and maybe know how Karen Carpenter died of anorexia after that . You guys just made me want to see Battleship after all . If you missed the mark on Dark Shadows , maybe you missed it on the other one . The producers foolishly thought the audience would identify with the personality - free dude because he had a pulse . The new movie was n't as politically correct as the first one . Guest . And you call yourself a fan . Prittirose . Big Fish was based of a book . It was one of the rare instances that the movie was better . Way better . Boo . Too long , dude . Way too fucking long . If you have this much to say on the matter , you should probably start your own website instead of cluttering up another 's comment section . But a couple of things : . They 're NOT professional film reviewers . The Brady Bunch IS more well - known to a mainstream audience than Dark Shadows . Nobody should have to \" study up \" on source material in order to see and enjoy a film that 's based on something else . A person 's OPINION on a film ca n't \" miss the mark . \" You 're a fool . misterT0AST . Fighting for your country does n't make you a good film actor . Just like discovering a cure for cancer does n't make you a good tap dancer . It 's apples and oranges . Battletits the Dark Boring . zzzz ..... wait ! what ? CudeQuem ? I 've been sleeping in every film ... no more $ for this . Money and a good PR agency will do that . Columbo should be well known enough these days . If the Brady Bunch is better known than that , we 're all in trouble . Check out episode 368 . You wo n't be disappointed . Gamegod1990 . Mike started off by being the funny weird one with Jay acting more of a normal person . Now Mike has fallen so deep into Flandardizing himself that he 's barely a coherent person . I think Mike thinks it 's funny . But his on screen character is getting out of control in terms of full on retardation that I 'm worried I wo nt think it 's funny anymore soon . Oh no , you might not find Mike funny any more ! I 'm sure everyone else that visits this site is incredibly concerned about what you specifically find funny ! Reimball . The last original live action Tim Burton movie was Edward Scissorhands , that was more than 20 years ago . Hafabee . Good reviews I love watching you guys you 're hilarious , ca n't wait for Prometheus , both to see it and it to see RLM 's review of it ! Caiden . No offense , but it 's hard to imagine the type of boys who would race home to watch Dark Shadows also liked to play baseball . I saw a few episodes YEARS ago , and while my memory may be spotty I remember it being extremely low budget , like a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie . Inside jokes are fine , but a good movie is more then inside jokes . As large as the fan base for DS is , it 's tiny compared to the rest of the Western world . So a joke a few thousand would get and millions missed is n't really a selling point . \" You got to see this it has references noone will get ! You wo nt know when they 're being made or why they 're funny ! \" The movie is seperate from the series . Throw in some nods and winks , sure , that 's expected . But it 's stupid to think millions of people are going to have to watch a few years worth of an old low budget 70s soap opera just to enjoy a 2 hour movie . Caiden . That 's the only reason ? Everyone who went to see the movie and did n't like it were 16 year old girls ? What about people not born in the 50s to watch a crudey soap opera during the 60s or people not born in the 90s ? What about people who hate Twilight , are n't we allowed to realize Burton is now a soulless hack turning out the same pale gothic cloths wearing protaganist movie after movie after movie ? Ca n't we look at Dark Shadows and say \" Bullshit \" ? CB . Who cares about \" in its time \" ? Today - or rather the time period encompassing both the Brady Bunch and Dark Shadows movies - which do you think is more widely recognized in pop culture ? That 's right , the Brady Bunch by a landslide . [ If you said Dark Shadows then try again until the previous sentence makes sense ] . And in - jokes are nice for fans of the original , but that example you gave about the girl changing her name ( in the movie , because she was running from her past ) as a reference to how the actress playing the character changed ? THAT 'S NOT A JOKE , IN- OR OTHERWISE . It 's just a reference to something that happened that you recognize . Just like \" Hey , lava lamps existed ! How kitschy were they ? \" is not a joke no matter how many of them decorated your dorm room . That was the big problem with this movie once you get past the incoherent mess of tonal whiplash . \" Jokes \" that were n't in fact jokes . As a matter of fact , Depp and a generation of young males , from the most popular to the nerds , did race home to see the hot women on the show running away from werewolves and vampires . And it was like a reality show so it did n't come across as third rate and more than the show \" Survivor \" was panned for it 's flaws in 2000 . Everyone knew it was practically taped live so there would be bloopers . Hey , they were human , and it was the child actors who made the most mistakes . Nonetheless , it was n't cool either than nor now for a boy to say he liked the Brady Bunch . And this all is n't that serious a subject . So the new film was n't aimed at \" a few thousand \" . It just was n't aimed at Millennials apparently . Yes , there were more references than jokes . Of all the shows I just mentioned , DS was the only one that males would admit to watching . It actually tried to appeal to guys . guest . at 24:15 ( h.b.c blowjob ) um . . .as hot as that sounds , that seems a little bit too adult for a movie selling itself as a goofy comedy . MatthewMelange . I think it 's funny that you guys walk through a glass door but in the next scene the door is solid . Malvert . Maybe it would be interesting to add some retro spin - off where you would talk about some old classic movies and how you see them now . I mean of course I would love to see Plinkett reviews of The Matrix sequels but I would like to know you opinion about the first movie as well . You talked about Rocketeer in Captain America episode but you were only scratching the surface with old Tim Burton movies in this episode . Steven Cross . Regarding Battleships I saw it and yeah its dumb but its a really enjoyable dumb . I 'm ex navy and I was chuckling away when I saw them get the Iowa back in action in a hour with several dozen people and fight its armament and get the machinery working , pure handwaivium . But if you 're going to see this kind of movie and expect it to be realistic , you 're either very dumb or very hopeful . Its like going to see Doom at the cinema and expecting it to have a deep , thoughtful storyline and well written plot . Its doom , its not going to have one . Now sit down and enjoy the dumb acting and ' splosions . I 'm also English . What the hell 's Dark Shadows ? Viehlipp . True word spoken ! ! ! And that was a nice one . CarlinWasRight . The Matrix sequels were so bad that I 've already forgotten them . The Start Wars prequels were so bad that it is hard to look at Yoda or Vader , in any context , anymore without thinking of the prequels . Or for that matter , Chewbacca in Taco Bell commercials , and so on . So no , do n't waste your time on putting together a Matrix review - the movies are forgettable shit and are already long gone . Dinga . Today , has become a strong negative , pay to watch crap . That 's the point . Brendan_cathcart . i thought Big Fish was the last good tim burton film . nice to see a movie that is n't monochromatic come from his camera . i doubt we will see much worth from him ever again . Holy Shit ! A SEPTERRA CORE refernece ! Plisket . Plistek . What was that reaction a little after 27:28 ? Factualnatural . Well George Lucas retired today , I 'm sure you guys had nothing to do with it . Becky . i have to say that i found battleship to be hilarious . my husband and i were laughing our asses off when the remaining navy captained by taylor kitsch shows up at the USS Missouri with women and the Japanese captain . i almost pissed myself laughing and i said , \" what , is this the USS Tolerance ?

I love Red Letter Media but I wish the guy posing as Plinkett would work a little harder : . Dinga . ILM continues its legacy X ) . Guest . You have n't watched The Grabowskis . Guest . You have n't met the Brady Bunch fanclub , that 's just how things are today . I know one person who knows of Dark Shadows . I 've seen zero episodes of the Brady Bunch , yet I know it exists and so does everybody else . It just -is- more well known . If 15 million Americans today know of Dark Shadows , something like 180 million probably know about the Brady Bunch , even if they 've never watched it . Guest . Battle : Los Angeles then Battleship ? WTF ? Did you just compare Battleship to Pieces ? o_O The latter one is pure campy geniousness , Battleship mostly meh - rated . Thanks about the Asylum tip , American Battleship seems worth seeing ! Guesto . Why is it that whenever they make an inside - outside transition , the doors NEVER ever match up ? Plinkett 's house does n't have a brick wall on the front porch , and the glass door they open in this review turns into a metal one when inside ! It 's craaaazy ! thomas040 . is there a way to subscribe to the \" half in the bag \" show ? ? i keep refreshing the page numerous times a day , just to see if the new one is up yet ... and what is the usual cycle ? 2 - 3 weeks ? Ca n't you make some more money on ads , so you can churn out an episode a week ? I FREAKING love this show ! ! ! to death ... keep it up guys . you are awesome .... . LOL ! The_house_guest . Touching and witty as always . I think you guys are at your best when breaking down movies that are a hot mess . That being said , I think you need to review \" What to expect when you are expecting \" . It 's the Citizen Kane of pregnancy comedies . DarthVaderHappyMeal . Thoroughly enjoyed your review of \" Battleship \" and \" Dark Shadows . \" Sorry I 'm late with a comment but I was trying to think of something funny to say . At last I found something - here goes : \" This super intelligent alien walks into a bar with his pet giraffe and ... , \" ah , hell ! , ... it 's so late no one 's left to read these comments anymore . stephen carrillo . I have a question , You guys never review or even mention animated films . You Even go as far as using the term \" cartoon \" as an insulting term to describe films . Are they below you ? Do you see them as a lesser medium ? Or am I reading too much into it ? Kyle_delaney . Yes , you are reading too much into it . They do n't use cartoon as an insulting term . They use it to mean cartoon . Something that 's wild and crazy and ridiculous that 's obviously not meant to be taken seriously . They also use the term schlock . Schlock could be considered insulting but they 're obviously fans of schlock when it 's appropriate . These people are experts in terrible movies . They attend the B movie festival every year . I do n't know how you could think any type of movie is below them . Animated films are just different . That does n't mean they 're worse . Red Letter Media has actually made some stop - motion films if that counts . Eathmysheint . JAY IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A MAN beard looks good bro . Shitheather . HOLY SHITTY PLINKETTE sounds like ellen degeneres . Cohnwrithe . Continuity ... you guys entered the building through a glass door , and cut to you entering through a metal door . WTF to that . MatthewMelange . i also wish they would review anime films like the secret world of arriety , but i really ca n't blame them for what they do or do n't review , they review what they want , we just watch . MatthewMelange . as a 23 year old , i did n't even know about dark shadows until this movie started showing trailers , the brady bunch i did know from syndication . MatthewMelange . i 'm still enjoying this show , i think they 're getting a better rhythm in terms of comedy . MatthewMelange . ACTUALLY , there was the corpse bride , but if you want to go live action , big fish was his last original ip . Johnny Depp was a massive performance in Dark Shadows cause the movie was written around him - like almost any Tim Burton movie is . What a waste of the great cast . Crosko23 . Hey Jerks . I did n't go and see Battleship BECAUSE I immediately knew it would be crap as soon as I saw the title of the movie . I DID see Avengers , because I enjoyed all the movies leading up to it , and felt like I was tricked into finally coughing up $ for a crappy summer blockbuster , poorly directed , over written , and poorly acted by pros phoning it in . Its not a question of movie execution , but review consistency . What I could n't understand was why one movie was excused in these reviews for having the same basic elements as another , less \" big deal \" movie . Also , I do n't know what you are referring to with your opening line , Guest . Avengers DID make me consider giving up comics and movies altogether . And ann rain is a dumb ass ! Underwaterbimbo . So the chicken Burrito was the Mcguffin in Battleship right ? Danny . Did Jay enjoy his Target brand bottled water that was apparently found on the floor of this abounded warehouse ? I agree . Willyc87 . i almost kill my self after seen Battleship , . Can we get this as an audio podcast ? Adam . I almost killed myself after reading your comment . did anyone noting that the aliens in Battleship tried very hard not to hurt anyone . they just want to go home . they only had one weapon . the where more like lost miners . Fuck_Commercials . What is it with this fucking commercials ? This is fuckin annoying ! g - town . ah , fuck you . deckameter . So they overdub mr . evans voice when \" mike \" and \" jay \" scream in pain ?

The cut - off date you guys are listing ( Beetlejuice ) for the last truly Tim Burtonish Tim Burton movie is set way too early . Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands are about as Tim Burtonish as you can get in movies . THUNDERSTTUCK ! ! ! person . the reason the movie flopped is that people knew it would be shit . pokey mcgee . ... what commercials ? Where ? I never saw any commercials . Bryan Ekers . I learned about Asylum 's knockoff \" American Battleship \" ( now retitled \" American Warships \" ) from this review and let me say - it 's a much better movie . you forgot to mention edward scissorhands . go_robo . no . not fantastic ... it 's JAWSOME ! ! ! DarklyDreamingDayln . I 'm still holding out for a film version of Brawny Paper Towels . dapur . I am currently dead . Christopher Kulik . I just take a shot every time I hear the ding in the background . savas101 . Battleship was n't as dumb as you guys thought . Look closely and it leaves the question whether the navy is the aggressors . The aliens never fire first and they are constantly on the defensive . The aliens create the barrier then take out any aggressive / offensive positions . The kid is spared the scientist walks into the area the alien engineers are and walks out freely . The aliens constantly determine if a target is friendly or not , even the destroyer is allowed to live once it turns around , even if it was easily taken out , then the aliens send one man in to simply disable the engines . I can go on and on . The only defence the navy has is it 's right to defend itself against the hostile force . savas101 . The movie is a bit stupid and the dialogue is really dull and I honestly had the same opinion as Mike and was n't sure what the deal was , but this side of the movie makes me enjoy it . Maybe the director actually meant this and he 's a genius , by following orders and doing a dumb movie while at the same time intriguing those who actually look at it properly . I felt the same way about both those ( well with Mike on Battleship ) . Battleship is incredibly stupid but enjoyable schlock , at least if you can get pass the first act which is pretty intolerable . And Dark Shadows has its moments but has little to no focus or drive until there 's only like 40 minutes left and by then it 's kind of too late . I really like H B C in it though . Calm Down Everyone . I kinda agree with Matty here . I hate ads . Bill Hicks anyone ... \"kill yourself , seriously \" . I do n't have a Facebook ect . because they shove ads down your throat and steal your info to sell to make more ads . No cable TV or commercial radio for me either . I 've donated to RLM for Star Wars and I wish there was a pay alternative on this site . They would make more than the .002 cents they get per ad . And people do this kinda stuff for free and the love of art all the time . You do n't HAVE to make a profit off it . I would pay for the hosting cost personally if they would take down the ads . Finally for all you people out there getting all hostile towards Matt 's simple , short stated opinion should take a deep breath and relax . U guys are the dicks who are doing 98 % of the bitching here . Attacking his opinion like he 's a horrible person for mentioning the adds on this site . I HATE the adds on this site now they are all sad shit like \" She was killed on impact \" . Fuckin buzz kill ! ! ! SnowBall . that 's not the same doors in the beginning . you hacks ! Trayan Iliev . I like Half in the Bag , though I 'm not crazy about it , but this one here ... this one was a masterpiece ! urrrborrr . \" Outside the box . you guys did n't like \" big fish \" with ewok mcgiver ? Obfuscationist . Learned just yesterday that Asano Tadanobu was in \" Battleship . \" Combine that with his being in the upcoming \" Chuushingura \" remake which stars Keanu Reeves , and I think I 'd better watch \" Last Life in the Universe \" next , to . . . y'know . . . get in the mood for my own suicide . Just hope I can hold on long enough to catch the next Plinkett review . Turtle . I bet there is a script sitting on someone 's desk . Robby . The ironic thing about Battleship is it probably could have played to a wider audience had they not associate themselves with the Hasbro game . Since it runs almost two and a half hours and only maybe five minutes is actual Battleship - the - game type stuff . If they had just tweaked it slightly and made a dumb action movie it might have been a bigger movie . They also could have renamed it Lens Flares : The Movie and no one would have questioned it . I thought Star Trek ' 09 had a lot of lens flares but holy hell . proghead777 . I watched the first episode of this series and I was like , \" meh \" , and forgot about it . \" Just give me another Plinkett review , thank you very much \" . Somewhere in the intervening episodes , it became something really good . Or , at least , it became something that my admittedly limited faculties could recognize as just as good as the Plinkett reviews . Why do I suck at predicting these things ? Now I have to go back and watch every single episode . AWESOME . proghead777 . Oh , dear sweet Christ , that is the future of movies , is n't it ? Chick flicks will be shit like , \" Tampax : The Absorbening \" . And we 'll have to watch them ! KILL ME ! ! ForwardEarth . Rich strait up forgot to talk like Plinkett in this one , and no one noticed . 2:57 looks like iron man hit the bottle again ... . Duckler . That spot on the wall behind Jay has made me try to wipe my screen three times now ... . Famguy210 . The scene where the combat played out like an actual game of battleship was so dumb it was funny , but the scene that really pissed me off was the one where they DRIFTED THE FUCKING BATTLESHIP ! ASS . Dark Shadows was fun ; your review was vague and made you seem way too cynical . How could you not mention the werewolf subplot that came straight out of left field ? ! Borous . Why could n't Battleship just be a big budget naval warfare action / thriller movie ? No aliens , no shitty characters , just two naval forces in a tense standoff maybe in a huge fog blind or something . I 'm one of those fans of the original show . I did n't care for the movie though . The show was terrible but charming . It was like old Dr. Who for monster lovers . I ca n't tell you exactly why the movie did n't work - which is why Mike and Jay seemed vague in their critique . It 's hard to point at exactly what went wrong . Because they pussed out on picking a contemporary bad guy . They ca n't do Russia anymore and North Korea does n't have much of a navy . It HAD to be aliens . It was the only thing left . Myself . Well apart from Ed wood he has also been in fear and loathing in las Vegas , wich I think is worth a watch . runciter . sleepy hollow was a pretty good movie . capnmorgan5150 . \" I want Battleship out of my head ! You and me both , brother ! AlcaldeEste .

The script was also horrible . williamsn411 . I ca n't believe Mike gave \" Battleship \" a positive review . Shame on you , Mike . Sully . Speaking of \" mock - busters \" , Amazon suggested THIS little gem to me today . Eric Monaghan . i really like the lighting on this set . Gregory Roth . AC / DC was a long time ago . it kind of is Grampa music now . omgnoway . I love when they have their reviews on the movie posters like \" It 's not as painful as you 'd think ! geoff . Very , very similar to my experience . Tyber Zann . especially when they did nt add it . And then someone farts \" . Tommy O. . Making everything look like Tim Burton made it ? Patrick . They could always go back in time to when the Battleship game was first made . I guess they just wanted to make something similar to Transformers to mooch off someone else 's success . Alex Lee . Such as it is . It is as dumb as can be expected . Joshua Barkdull . Everything the guys said about Dark Shadows was true . But they left out one very important element . It had lots of payoffs with no build up , and lots of buildups with no real payoff . Two examples : ( spoilers ? ) 1 ) At the end of the movie the teenage girl is suddenly , out of nowhere a werewolf . For apparently no reason other than she was probably one on the show . As for teh audience we get to see that she s rebellious . We see that she is a bit of hippie . But throughout the whole movie there are no clues that she is a werewolf . It just comes out of nowhere because the filmmakers were bored of the already too long action sequence . Yet it 's treated as this big reveal . As if everyone watching is suddenly going to put all the pieces together in their head and be like \" oooooh I see ! \" and get excited and invested anew in this fight sequence . But because it had no build up , no clues to piece together , the payoff just does n't work . 2 ) Throughout the whole movie we get teased by the powers the little boy might have . He often talks about his dead mother . He seems oddly dark and mysterious . Even disturbed . He can communicate with the dead apparently . The whole reason the love interest girl is even at the mansion and thus in the movie is to take care of this kid who clearly has a lot going on . You get way more build up than typical for this sort of a character and then the \" pay off \" is he asks his moms ghost to chase a guy through the house for about 5 seconds . That 's it . He does n't shoot lighting from his fingers . He does n't float 3 feet above the floor and zip around the room . He does n't use his mind to toss lamps at the witches head . He just cries out to his mom . The teenage girl with the big \" reveal \" has no setup and the kid with all the setup has no payoff . Were these two characters once the same character in some earlier draft ? Was the boy supposed to be a werewolf and had kept it a secret because werewolves and vampires are enemies ? Then again this is based on a show , so was the kid with the super power of being a huge disappointment on the show ? I would have been okay with them taking artistic liberties with that one . Then you have the totally predictable ending of HBC underwater at the end . So predictable of an ending in fact that people who have n't even seen the trailer let alone the movie probably saw that one coming . Jakefrom state farm . Mike delivered the line \" Lord why have forsaken me ! ? \" as comically as a line out of Red Tails . Zero Sum . Why did they name their ship after the bass player from Led Zeppelin ? This movie is so confusing ! AndyAce83 . What I think about asylum movies and other cheap movies is that if you skip trough the film you see just endless talking scenes . I have skimed trough a bunch of these films on Netflix and its talking , talking , talking . I may have skimmed the wrong movies but that is what I see . capnmorgan5150 . \" I want Battleship out of my head ! We ALL want Battleship out of our head ! Duckler . It left mine about 17 minutes after I watched it . I do remember laughing at it a lot though . capnmorgan5150 . I guess Jay did n't find any half dranks beers in the dumpster . Greg Toombs .

Oh lord , why have you forsaken us ? AAAAARRRRHHHHHHHH ! ! ! Jennifer Elise Bunnell . Battleship definitely did feel like the palatable version of a Transformers film for me . There were a lot of parallels in tropes and visual style , but it never made me angry or have to suppress vomiting , and I did get some chuckles out of a few scenes . It 's a weird movie to champion , but it really does irk me that it did so much worse than its far more heinous cousins . In a nonsensical way , it makes me want to tell people \" Watch Battleship ! No really ! Watch it . Watch it . The only thing more surprising than mike being \" okay \" with Battleship ( an opinion i share completely by the way ) is that they both liked Dark shadows ... can't make any sense of that , that movie was pure garbage . Peter Berg is an alright director , I liked The Kingdom , and I really really like The Rundown ... but that s everything of his that I 've seen . He 's definitely a \" ' Splosions \" kinda director but somehow manages to escape being gratingly stupid . sonicjrjr14 . Not really . sonicjrjr14 . I did n't care much for Dark Shadows , but I also view Tim Burton differently than you guys . I love his recent films for the most part : Big Fish , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ( like it more than the 71 movie ) , Alice in Wonderland , Sweeney Todd , Corpse Bride , and Frankenweenie . Planet of the Apes and Dark Shadows fall more in the ' meh but not awful ' category of Burton movies for me . No , really ! Paulus Cañamonjas . The intro segment , where Mike is talking about his breast reduction surgery ... omg . I 'm in tears . Richard Thomas . I like Dark Shadows as a Halloween type of feel movie . It 's not the greatest movie , but my favorite holiday is Halloween and with all the characters Vampire , ghost , witch etc puts a smile on face . Let me weigh in on something here ... as much as I would enjoy sticking any one of my fingers in Eva Green 's poophole ... Michelle has her beat by a country mile on hotness ... . mcdanieldrew . did you see the shitfest that was ' 9 ' ? Guest . This review was 50 % longer than the damne special was . The Badger . I watched DS and the first ten ( non Depp ) moments started out as an intriguing film in it 's own right , with some interesting character development and foreshadowing . But then it seemed they could not rush Depp onto screen fast enough which totally changed the tone . No intrigue . Then in the end they shoehorned a bunch of monsters of the week and ... ending . There was a good film here . Tim Burton could not build it . harry . look up forgettable in the dictionary and instead of an entry it 's just a tiny picture of 9 's poster . Sp0ckr0ck . You guys should make an episode about the Act of Valor . You 'll love its script and acting . It 's less painful than you 'd expect ! disqus_fnwCMQDX7u . No mention of Edward Scissorhands ? Marc Wilds . I actually enjoyed ' Battleship ' it 's just a big dumb simple action movie with as much basis in reality as a 1950 's B - movie . I kinda like that , it 's refreshing that it does n't aspire to be more than that . I mean you can tell it 's ment to be campy given all the non - actors cast in it . I rather watch this 4 times than watching those 4 incoherent Transformer movies , the ones with big chrome piles of junk you ca n't tell apart punching each other over and over again . It 's all just an excuse to see Navy ships and sailors doing cool Navy stuff . I 'm fine with that as long as it 's done well , and is goofy fun , ' Battleship ' is . It had the chance to be hilarious . But it seems that the writers went for the lazy tired gags instead of actually being creative or adding any sort of cleverness to the jokes ... for the most part .

Most of the movie is just a bunch of jokes that seem like they were concocted by a 9 year old . The jokes are just so unbelievably lazy and off putting .

This is like Adam Sandler 's huge dump made into a movie . I guess he just wanted to take a piss and waste all his money . I know this film is not for everybody , everyone has their own opinion of Adam Sandler but I thought this movie was one of his better ones in recent memory .

Why in the world does anyone have to make movies like this where a teacher is having sexual encounters with very young people . Is this not illegal ? No wonder our world is the way it is .

Every now and again Vanilla Ice turns up and makes you laugh a bit . The keywords in that sentence were \" a bit \" . No moments made me laugh very loudly and when I did smirk it was a joke completely unconnected to the rest of story which is in the movie just to attract the easily satisfied . However it must be pretty hard to attempt to connect a joke to the story when the story almost does not exist . Not Sandlers worst ( definitely Samberg 's worst ) but utterly pointless and really quite boring . ... Expand . Yeah , it 's raunchy and controversial , but frickin ' hilarious . I 'd rather be entertained than educated . One of the great things about this film is it does n't care what people think . Just does it anyway .

I thought Andy Samberg even had a chance to save it from being a total disaster , but he did n't improve the film at all . When watching the first 15 minutes of the film , I knew instantly that it was only going to get worse , and boy was I right . I actually want to thank Sandler in a way , he has shown me over the years how terrible a comedy can truly be , and I think this film proves that it 's only going to get worse in the future . I have seen very few movies in my lifetime where every single character is completely unlikeable and creepy as the people in this film . As long as I have a single breath in my body , I will do everything in my power to never see this film again , and I do n't recommend it to anyone on this earth or the next . ... Expand . Nice movie to watch it once relaxing . Lots of jokes , Adam Sandler , Vanilla Ice ( ! ! ! ) I 've noticed that all of these stupid comedy movies bring some obvious but good ideas . This one 's idea is about family values and love for parents and it 's covered by a ton of toilet humor . It is hard to find a comedy nowadays that can give genuine rip - snorting laughter but the writers and actors contained herein pull it off with an edginess that gives testimony to the fully realised talents of the stars . After several flops of recent times , Sandler finally fulfils the role he has angled at playing for so long and the storyline unleashes all the fun - filled fantasies that gratuitous \" adults \" will somehow find familiar , with a whole heapin ' helpin ' of absurd frivolity . Sandler positively shines and finds his element through the abundance of \" dick jokes \" and it makes all other films of the same genre look tame in comparison . If you 're a jock , a rocker , a redneck or have the ability to see the comedy in every day life , then this will be a favourite for all - time . Forget what the so - called professional critics and sad - sacks say , add this to your collection because you will want to watch it with your friends . I laughed my ass off ! ... Expand . Seriously underrated by critics . This is the hardest I have laughed at an Adam Sandler comedy in a long , long time . Only bad thing about this movie is the terrible accent Sandler uses for his character . Besides that , It was a pretty good and I am glad I gave it a chance . Now this is more like it . Finally Adam Sandler goes back to the type of comedy that made him famous and leaves that little kid crap behind . Was this movie completely ridiculous ? Was if full of profane language and crude humor ? Was there needless dialogue and random cameos ? Yes , yes , and yes . Would you want an Adam Sandler movie any other way ? Hell no . That 's My Boy was a box office mess . The film was slammed by critics . So what ? I do n't see nothing wrong with the movie . As far as those tasteless reviews goes , I 'm still a Adam Sandler fan and I think this is one of his better R - rated movies since Funny People . Very raunchy , very entertaining , I wonder if Andy Samberg could join Sandler in Grown - Ups 2 . That would be awesome . That 's my boy is great trash . It 's every dirty joke we ever thought up cranked out to the extreme . Yet even on top of all this shameful fun , it has some heart , perhaps not enough to bring it up from the trenches , but it still surprised me . C'mon guys ! This is top notch Sandler comedy ! One of his best films in years . If you were one of many who were dissappointed by Jack and Jill , then do n't be scared off . That 's My Boy is funnier , constructed better , and more offensive than any Sandler production in years . The laughs are waaaaaaaaaay better here . I 'm a huge Adam Sandler fan and I absolutely love his comedies . I always look forward to the next Sandler film and this one was no different . I could n't wait to see it . Now that I 've finally seen it I can say that the movie , while having some funny moments , was actually a big disappointment for me . I was expecting it to be his funniest movies yet . It 's a lot different from the rest of I 'm a huge Adam Sandler fan and I absolutely love his comedies . I always look forward to the next Sandler film and this one was no different . I could n't wait to see it . Now that I 've finally seen it I can say that the movie , while having some funny moments , was actually a big disappointment for me . I was expecting it to be his funniest movies yet . It 's a lot different from the rest of Sandler 's films , it 's his raunchiest yet and he drops the f - bombs for the first time in a long time , probably more times than he ever has before . Despite these differences they do n't make the movie any funnier . Most of the jokes are predictable and I could see them coming WAY before they were made . Other times it 's just not funny , only manages to get a little chuckle , or is just too gross . There were a few moments that did bring some genuine laugh out loud moments , but they were few and far between . It 's a decent Sandler flick with some great cameos , and worth a rental for Sandler fans just to see him try something new , but do n't expect anything that great . ... Expand . I used to love Adam Sandler , but the last thing I remember that was any good was Grown Ups . Funny People was not funny , I wo n't even mention Jack and Jill . but this film had an OKAY idea , but what a terrible execution . It was n't funny , was mostly offensive and was kind of disgusting . I 'm really surprised they were allowed to release this . Giving it 1/10 because it COULD have been good . I really am a big fan and I love Adam Sandler and defend and seen some really bad reviews for this movie . Personally I think the latest movies of Adam Sandler lose their essence as such in Jack and Jill and grown ups , this movie did not expect much but I really loved it because it felt like one of the old movies of Adam Sandler . I do n't know why all the negativity towards this film . It was n't horrifyingly bad . I 've seen worse movies , sure is this the best movie I 've ever seen ? Absolutely not . But is it one of the worst ? No . In fact , I found the movie really got going towards the late middle / end of the film . Granted , that 's a long wait for humor but I found it worth it . Lonely Island 's Adam Sandberg ( I believe ? ) I do n't know why all the negativity towards this film . It was n't horrifyingly bad .

Lonely Island 's Adam Sandberg ( I believe ? ) played great and the connection him and Adam Sandler had was most definitely there . However , I found parts of the movie were missing and the movie went to fast in some parts ; which would and will confuse some audiences . Also , I do n't recommend going to see this movie with your mother ; it 's quite awkward . Anyway , I hope you take my review into consideration when going to rent this movie . Have a great day . ... Expand . This movie was just terrible . While I laughed a few times , it was n't worth my time . The language was offensive and the lingo was overused and not necessary . The sexual theme was overdone and over the top .

Brought back were the days of Happy Gilmore and Billy Maddison . The ensemble cast of former stars was also an incredible addition . If you grew up in the 80 - 90 's you should LOVE this movie !

I am telling everyone I know not to waste their time or money on the diaster . That 's my boy , I have previewed the movie on - line , and so far it sucks the most of all movies , I ever previewed in my entire life . It does n't make any sense .

He got his son drunk , high and in trouble with his soon to be bride . He got his own son drunk and the son vomits on his soon to be wife 's wedding dress , yuck . Besides the not so funny disgusting scene and filthy language , the bride to be is n't even a nice person , but a evil witch . Back to the father and son 's age difference , Adam is n't even old enough to be that boy 's father . Their not that far from tens years apart in age . The humor is n't even there and the whole storyline falls so flat , that it is so horrible . If it makes millions in ticket sales over the weekend , it is a real shock to me . Because I would never waste my money on this not so funny movie . The movie is n't funny at all , and no one who has the right mind would never , ever , dare waste their time and money to watch it . Watch out Oscars , because this movie will never dare to be nominated for anything you can handle . this is the worst movie of decades , and many more to come . ... Expand .

I had my doubts about it but I was still going to watch and it actually is a plus movie . It 's nowhere near a perfect movie but it 's one of the funniest Adam Sandler movies I have seen ( and I have seen all Sandler movies ) . The bachelor party scene was exactly as I pictured before watching it . Filled with strippers , alcohol , nudity , and there is a sex scene at the party , but it 's not that graphic or prolonged . Donny Berger ( Adam Sandler ) hit on his seventh grade teacher so many times that Ms. McGarricle ( Eva Amurri Martino ) finally had enough of the flirting . First day in detention Ms. McGarricle starts flirting back and eventually she takes him to her \" teacher room \" to .... teach him things . They start having a fling and they 're eventually caught and she goes to jail for thirty years while knocked up . Thirty years pass and Donny has been famous for knocking up his teacher and has been too distracted to not pay taxes since ' 94 . He 's told if he does n't pay 43,000 dollars at the end of the weekend then he must serve jail time . He is forced to join up with his son , Todd Peterson AKA Han Solo Berger ( Andy Samberg ) .

Sure , it 's lowbrow as hell , but I laughed consistently throughout , and the movie has a heart . Loved seeing some of the Grandma 's Boy vets , and Vanilla Ice is terrific .

Sandler ca n't quite adopt that same cynical edge , instead favoring corny and sentimental resolutions to untenable predicaments . Great review . Making a sequel to the original Halloween is an awful idea ; it just ca n't be done , no matter how hard you try . It 's really annoying when there are sequels to a movie or book that ends on a perfect cliffhanger . The series would have been better if they had used Carpenter 's original idea , which was to make each new movie be it 's own separate story , and the only bond between them would be that they all take place on Halloween night . They made a mistake in having Michael Myers be in Pt . 2 , because then in Pt . 3 , people expected him again , and thus did n't like 3 being different . If 2 had been different right off the bat , people would have expected 3 to be different as well , and the series could have been fresh and new with each installment . Oh well ... . I liked 2 a lot , but it was not creepy , like James says . Part 1 is scary without showing any blood , this sequel is an overdose of blood and its not that scary . The fact that we now why Michael hunts for Laurie , just took away all the mystery and fright of the first movie and the whole character . But for me it was still a satisfying movie . Seeing Myers walking behind here at the end of the hallway is just unforgettable to me . This is probably also the only Halloween movie with all the horrific and gory kills . Later sequels would n't show much blood at all . I laughed my ass of when I saw Halloween 3 . I soo bad , it 's funny . People should watch it just because of that . Weird that James does n't say anything about the huge plotholes or situations in the movie . I also wish Halloween would 've went the anthology route , Halloween 3 is better than most other Halloween sequels . It could 've been awesome to see what all they could 've came up with , but no , cry babies just HAD to have shitty Michael Myers doing the same old shit . Yawn ! IN JOHN CARPENTERS HALLOWEEN , MICHAEL MYERS LURKED THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE EVERYDAY LAID BACK RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND BROUGHT FEAR IN OUR BACKARDS . IN HALLOEEN II , MICHAEL LURKED THROUGH THE HALLWAYS OF A HOSPITAL . WHERE HE BRINGS FEAR , AND CARRIES DEATH TO A PLACE THAT BRINGS HOPE , AND LIFE .... Halloween 2 was a pretty good sequel . Probably not as good as the first but up there . The movie reveals michael , and lauries connection and dr loomis discovers michaels link to samhain . Great film . And yes , I do love HALLOWEEN III . Every feels like the ending to the original Halloween was a set up for a sequel , but I disagree . The end was perfect WITHOUT a sequel . The idea was that Michael Myers could be anywhere . In your house , in the backseat of your car ... anywhere . With that being said , I liked Halloween 2 . I thought it was good in a different way than the original . It has this real dream like , surreal quality about it . The bright vivid colors and the melencholy mood makes you feel like it 's real late night / early , early morning when no one is awake and all of this terrible , macabre shit is going down . It has a very strange and weird feel to it and I think that 's a good thing looking back on it . But again ... it 's so different from the original and worth checking out for different reasons . Halloween 3 was actually very entertaining . I do n't really consider it part of the series , but I enjoy it . I see it as a completely different movie and when looked at like that it 's pretty damn good . So what ? Loomis , Laurie , and Michael are n't in it . That does n't make the movie bad , and I actually appreciate the vision that Carpenter had for the rest of the series . I 'm stoked to see your Halloween 4 review . IMO it is the second best of the series behind the original . Great , top notch atmosphere and some really great characters that you feel for . Definitely close to the first in terms of quality for me . Ca n't wait to see the rest . somehow i m do nt entirely agree with u. i think helloween 2 its almost as good as 1 . they just wanted to make a finale for the first part . if they show michael myers more than in the firt movie its becouse they wanted to , also there is more slashing becouse people was asking for it . i was a fan of these two movies since a kid , i m older than u so i saw them when released . i loved helloween thanks to this movies . about the third part , well , sucks as hell so ill not comment about it . ill wait for ur reviews on part 4,5 , 6 , h20 , etc . and btw the second part was directed by Rick Rosenthal and not Carpénter . Good review of Halloween 2 . Halloween 3 no offense that was fuking sloppy . I actually watched that same top 10 today cos i knew u would include 3 tomorrow though was n't expecting it tonight . Sorry to say i am really disappointed that u did n't go further into some of the scenes of halloween 3 . I do also agree on the notion that HALLOWEEN should never had sequel . Even John Carpenter did not want to do it . But he was talked into it , and was also talked into producing HALLOWEEN.III whiched failed . Carpenter sold the rights of the series to the late Moustapha Akkad , and washed his hands clean of the series . I do nt blame him . HALLOWEEN stands alone as a ground breaking feat in suspence , fear , and a superb film of the genre . I love the sequels that progressed . But the sequels feel more like a 2D story of the characters that we are just watching where we feel for them like the original . I really should check out the third movie one of these Octobers . Not this one , though , I 'm backed up on horror movies at it is . I agree on all parts regarding the second one . Not as good as the first , but decent , and the one that does the best job of mixing the feel of the first movie with the base slasher franchise it went on to be . Halloween II has it 's good points and it 's bad . It is really the only solid Myers sequel , simply because it does introduce plot points that seem to have become accepted canon for the Michael and Laurie character across all of Halloween . I like that it picks up the very same night , and Donald Pleasance is always good ! Felt like Jamie Lee barely did anything in this movie . She was doped and comatose until the very end . Halloween 3 was one of those movies that I avoided like the plague until about 2 years ago ... And to be quite honest i was stunned by how good a movie it was . I did not expect this , based on all the Halloween fans derision of it . Tom Atkins makes for a likeably silly protagonist , and the ungonk - ungonk commercial is the stuff of legend . Throw in one of the greatest intensely ambiguous horror endings of all - time , and you have an underrated gem . Nice to see the reviews of 2 and 3 . I actually have n't seen these myself . I 've seen H20 and the remake , and the first one , and I 'm not sure what else . Seems like I definitely need to check these two out , though ! It felt a little lazy that he just used footage from another one of his videos when discussing Halloween 3 , but I suppose you could run out of things to say when discussing the same movie so many times . I really wish they had gone with Carpenter 's idea and have the series be an anthology revolving around Halloween . The first one ended so perfectly , a sequel , let alone 8 of them , really take away its power . It would have been cool to see all the new stories revolving around Halloween . Excellent review James and I liked that you included the review of part 3 from the top 10 vid . It gives it another chance to gain some exposure because it 's a good horror film and I 'd loved to have seen more Halloween movies in that direction , which was also the initial idea with the first one mind you . I got Halloween about 3 months ago I still have n't seen it because i was saving it for Halloween and when i herd you where doing a sequel - a - thon i was praying you 'd do one of these slasher movie series and i got my wish twice . great reviews James you 're the reason i watch Horror movies . It would have been cooler is Michael changed costumes so you would never know which person on the street would be the killer . Every Halloween , he would keep changing costumes and killing people . And you could sell an awful lot of costumes each year . I agree with Halloween 2 being a good sequel that comes close to the original . I now know you are doing Halloween remake and it 's sequel probably on the 30th with Halloween : Resurrection . I do n't care much for Halloween 3 I mean it was okay . I am looking toward to seeing Halloween 4 review tomorrow . Keep up the good work James . I think I 'm going to have to give Halloween III a re - watching because I never made it past the first 10 to 20 minutes . I was never upset that Michael was n't in it . I was pissed off cause they kept flipping to TV 's showing trailers for the first two Halloween films and that Halloween III has nothing to do with the first two . It should have been simply called Season Of The Witch and had all trailers of the other Halloween films removed from it . I do remember watching halloween 3 and i hated it . It just seemed stupid with some of the scenes . SPOILER ALERT ! Such as the scene where the chick who TOm atkinson travels with goes insane I thought it was really annoying how many times she came bak to life . I was really hoping you would talk the good points and bad points of 3 since its the most hated u could of gave it more of a praise . Though I think by far its the worst and this was me watching it fully knowing that michael myers was n't in it other than trailers . sorry James , but Halloween 3 was total shit all around . To this day I 'm disappointed I spent a Halloween night watching that shit . I myself like the premise of having a different premise each movie , but this movie guaranteed that was never going to be taken seriously . oh , and listen to nostalgia critic 's review of it to hear an argument not solely focusing on \" no Michael Myers \" . I remember taping Halloween 3 on the VCR and watching it later that night after trick or treating and just being so damned confused . Back then we had no internet and my Parents did nt know what the hell I was talking about . Looking back it was not that bad of a movie . I do n't think Michael swinging blindly was an awful scene . I also think the hospital chase scene was nearly as good as the first movie 's chase scene . Obviously the original is better , but I treat Halloween 1 & 2 as one movie . Every Halloween I watch them both . Halloween 3 was the first Halloween film that scared me so much that I could barely sleep by myself . I first saw it on TNT 's Monster Vision with host Joe Bob Briggs . Although it scared me back then , today it is one of my favorite horror movies . I even bought reproductions of all 3 Silver Shamrock Masks complete with the Silver Shamrock Novelties tag in the back . Although I have watched many horror films since then and thought I was invincible to horror movie fear , but in early 2009 I watched something online that scared me so much that I 've been seemingly scarred for life . To this day I stil have n't recovered from it . I do n't think Halloween 3 is underrated . It has some good scenes ( specially the gorier ones ) , and I agree it takes some balls to show children getting killed like this movie does , but overall is boring and a waste of film . I remember how disappointed I was when watched it for the first time and realize it has nothing to do with the first 2 films , but that was a long time ago . Watching now , judging by its own merits did n't help . It was a piece of crap back then , it 's a pice of crap now . Hi James ! ! I was wondering when you would get to The Halloween series . In sweden the halloween movie is called \" alla helgons blodiga natt \" translated to english : all hallows eves bloody night . I laugh every time i think of it . I hate how they managed to fuck up the series as(s ) in all damn franshises . It´s Cinemassacres Maunsteerr Maaaadneeeesssss Mohahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha . I´m so sorry , I don´t have anything better to do with my life . To each his own mates . However James f you ever read this I think you missed a very important point with Halloween 1 and 2 . In my mind they essentially are a 2 parter and as such should be viewed back to back . When you are absolutely fresh after the first one the second one does n't need its own build up since the first one serves as exactly that . I 'd even go as far as saying they should make a dvd with parts 1 and 2 edited into a huge single movie for the quintessential Halloween night marathon , to allow the viewer to fully immerse in the entirety of the story . I saw Halloween 3 as kid and was freaked out by the concept ( killer insect masks ) and the effects , but I watched it again a few years ago and it did n't hold up . This has nothing to do with Michael Myers not being in it . Taken as it is , as a stand - alone movie , it 's not very good . It 's not utter crap , but it is bad in a lot of ways . The idea is still interesting , but it suffers from a lot of problems that plague many horror movies , like logical lapses , cheesy effects and lazy writing . I appreciate what it tried to do , but it still failed , in my opinion . I think its biggest downfall was that it tried to do too much , between the cult story , the town , the mystery , the masks . Horror works best , I think , when it 's smaller in scope , with a limited group in a small area . Or , if the scope is big , keep it locked on one horrific idea , not three or four . Spread the story too far and it 's easy to lose focus . Hey , James ! Excellent Monster Madness this year ! I laugh everytime I see E.T. in that monster line - up at the beginning . Imagine if somebody re - made E.T. 20 years from now , though not understanding it very well , it turns into a new series of horror movies with the likeness of The Extra Terrestrial ! Actually , that would be a funny movie about re - makes / reboots ... . I do n't like Halloween 2 , I think it was pointless and destroyed the wonderful ending that the first one had . Carpenter 's films always have a really ambiguous endings which is kind of like a signature of his . Halloween 2 seems very unecessary and is really nothing more than a cash grab to bank on the success of the original . I wish Halloween 2 would 've been a fresh and original story , the anthology idea was brilliant ! Halloween III Season of the Witch I feel is just a bad film in its own right . I admire it for trying to ditch the Myers story , but yeah .... It 's got some cool ideas and such , but I really think it 's just a bad film by itself . Come on James . You can do better than t his . 2 to 3 minutes for each video is way too damn short . Oh yeah I 'm sure you 're really busy with that remake of Planet 9 or whatever its called . Spend more time with the sequel a thons for your Monster Madness . AND QUIT IT WITH THE DAMN SWEARING . I totally dig on pretty much everything you do James , especially this but I just had to say . The stupid Assassins Creed commercial has totally soured me to ever playing that game lol . I know you do n't have control over it but hearing that stupid song now makes my ears bleed . Keep up the good work James . I liked halloween 2 for showing more gore , but 3 was ingenius . people need to look past the fact that Micheal is n't in it and appreciante it for what it is ; a cfreepy , scary film with deaths and a good story . The running killer comes up in a spin off of halloween - prom night , which , in the classic 1980 version , is a great movie . The sewuel .... no running killer . Also , one thing that changed between halloween 1 and 2 that piisses me off is how Micheal goes down stairs - slowly , almost lady like , where in the first movie he was fast and menacing ! Very interesting review . I liked the comparison of the fire scene with the scene from the Thing , and the little explanation about how the way Slasher villains move is inspired on the Mummy . That 's the kind of trivia I like from the Monster Madness reviews . I think the idea of doing a different story every movie was an original idea , a shame it did n't worked . I ca n't say much thought , I have n't watched the Halloween movies yet , but I plan watching them in Halloween night this year . @urrutiap : What do you mean 2 to 3 minutes ? Today 's video was more than 5 minutes long , not including the second part of the video . You keep complaining about the swearing . We get it , you do n't like it . But remember there are plenty of people here who do n't mind the swearing , you are n't the only one watching these videos . And even if James decides to take in consideration your complains , he probably has these videos ready ahead of time , so it 's not like he 's going to change them the day after you comment on them . I think from now on , we should all just completely ignore the comments made by urrutiap . If we start to reply on the crap being said , it just feeds their ego and fuels them . If we all shutter it , it just becomes a single dumb post is a sea of legitimate comments , regardless if they like the review of hated it . \" I met this six year old child with this blank , pale , emotionless face , and the blackest eyes ; the devil 's eyes . I spent eight years trying to reach him , and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy 's eyes was purely and simply ... evil . \" To put it on other words , He 's been beaten , shot , set of fire , Michael Myers is possessed by a darkness that can not die . John Carpenter did n't leave the Halloween series outright after the second one ; he still served as the producer for the third movie ( which more than likely means it got his blessing ) and the composer for III , 4 , and 5 . I agree that Halloween 2 should have been the last . The ones after 3 that contained Myers just milked it . And yes 3 did get blown out of proportion and hated , but for all the right reasons . It should nt have been called Halloween 3 , but a movie of its own with its own title . That s enough right there to piss anyone off that was expecting a new Myers flick . Overall , however , it was decent , nothing special . It had its moments , good idea , but was nt executed properly , and a tad boring at times . Look quickly for Dana Carvey in his film debut . He plays the reporter 's assistant . Also , in reference to Halloween III , I still think it 's a pretty terrible film . For the most part , I found it boring and not very scary . There were perhaps one or two chilling moments but that 's all . I think they should 've just called it Halloween : The Season of the Witch instead of Halloween III . I believe that it was the roman numeral that really threw people off when seeing this film , thinking that it tied in with the first two films . Speaking of which , I remember reading that there was originally a sub - plot in Halloween III that involved a scientist sifting through the remains of Michael Myers . If that scene really existed at one point , I think they perhaps should 've left it in . Great reviews as always . I love Monster Madness ! I 'm listening to a radio interview right now on YouTube with Tommy Lee Wallace , the writer and director of Halloween III on YouTube . Here 's the link if you ( or anyone here ) wants to listen to it . I notice James has taken more time to discuss this series so far , and he kind of rushed through the \" Nightmare on Elm Street \" series . I do n't have a problem with that , it 's just what I think . I liked Halloween III , its was actually pretty good if you did n't jump all over it about how it did n't have Michael in it . I always kinda thought It would have done better if they woulda just called it Season of the Witch , and dropped the halloween III just so it could have at least been its own movie . I do n't think I have ever heard anyone say anything other than they hate it just because it does n't have Michael in it either . In my opinion a sequel has to be really good since it has to at least carry as much story , depth , and originality as the first one . I do n't feel that any of the Halloween sequel 's have any of that and serve to make Michael Myers more of a characacher than something to fear . I feel like Halloween III should have featured Abbot & Costello it might have been better . This also applies to the Nightmare , and Friday The 13th series as well . Another great review James . This sequel along with H20 are the best in the series imo . I agree though that first is the best and few movies are as scary as the first . After all the horror movies I have seen , from new to old , and original to remake , the original Halloween still stands as a film that can scare me and it takes a lot to scare me . I love the trivia you give in these reviews and I appreciate all the time you give to us for these reviews . Also I would n't mind the other people complaining . The average Monster Madness video is 3 - 5 mins long so I do n't understand why all the nit picking . People are upset because you did not give the ANOES franchise more attention but hey you picked that one ! I do n't see why people complain when your doing this for free ! You are giving your time to us and that says a lot ! Not to mention you still did an AVGN video this month and your busy with the AVGN movie and you still give us MM , and not only that but overall you have increased the timing of the videos . To me that is awesome ! On a last note Halloween is my favorite horror series , though I think there are some better stand alone ones . I think TCM is better than Halloween but I love the Halloween series more so I ca n't wait to see your opinions on them ! I watched most of halloween 3 last night trying to give it a second shot . The first time i watched it i was not aware of the new direction they were going and was royally irked when there was n't michael myers . I kept waiting for him to pop out and start killing . Watching it last night i seriously tried to give it a honest shot , but still i think it was nt a good movie . The overall premise is spot on , but i think it is poorly executed . It does nt have the suspense , or the scare that the myer 's films have . Also the music through out was simply annoying to me . So in my opinion i think it was an honest shot at something better than a slasher franchise , but it was poorly executed . had it been an outstanding movie in its own right then people could have shrugged off the lack of myers . Am i the only one here who 's genuinly confused about Ellie from the third one just being gone at the end of the film ? We never get to see what happened to her and why in the fuck would Silver Shamrock make a robot copy of her ? What am i missing here ? I like the 2nd . It finished the myers persona nicely . He and his opponent are dead . Classic showdown . Everything else after this with myers is just crap really . They make a good crazy psycho into a form of evil . It killed the whole , this could happen that made the first one great . Now myers is a freddy or jason , something that could never happen in real life . It destroyed the true horror . I really like the 3rd one . Because I knew it was going to be a anthology of halloween themes . But since people did nt see myers in it , it was dumped on . But he was nt suppose to be in it . It 's a new story . It 's a great stand alone movie , and would have liked to see more along the lines . But people bulked and this movie did nt do well in theaters . It goes along the lines of trick r treat . I liked that the town of santa mira is the same town in invasion of the body snatchers . and the gas station is the one in the fog for you film buffs . Part II and H2O are my favorites , Hospitals are just naturally creepy , so a slasher stalking the halls just makes it moreso for me . While I get why people love the original , I liked this one much more . And I am one that hates teh open ending and am fully satified with II 's finale . Halloween III isn;t that bad at all , once you get past it is n't a true sequel . Tom Atkins is always a joy to see , and Dan O'Herlihy is both eerie and hysterical as the villain . I love when O'Herlihy is explaining his process to Atkins and talks about how he got the big magical Stonehendge rock . i actually found Halloween 2 MORE frightening and suspenseful than the original . maybe it 's because i watched them back - to - back and had the tension from part one still fresh on my mind . i also think the hospital setting helped the creep factor . I 'm sure it 's already been mentioned but the kid who got totaled by the cop car is not wearing a boiler suit . Look closely and you 'll notice it 's actually 2 pieces so definitely not the same thing Michael wears . Personally to me it looks like the kid is wearing a jean jacket and jeans , both dark blue , as opposed to Michael 's dark grey jumpsuit . On a side note the kid is the same guy that Laurie 's friend in the first movie tried to set her up with or at least has the same name . Anyway I also wanna point out the reason for the change in setting in part 2 . Rick Rosenthal the director , who had basically no experience at the time as a director , wanted to shoot the movie in pre von sternberg german expressionism . So lots of long hallways and alternative view points . As for Part 3 well it 's just a worthless movie . Granted it 's been a long time since I 've seen it but based on what I remember the acting was bad , the plot was sketchy at best and even at it 's creepiest moments it was n't . The high point of the film is the deaths which frankly they would have been better off releasing as a set of short horror snuff films . My problem with Halloween III was n't that Michael Meyers was n't in it . It was because it was bad . First of all , the plot is so inconceivably retarded , it takes a special kind of person to actually believe in it . I mean , I know it 's fiction and all , but seriously- are you kidding me ? Some stereotypical Bond villain tries to kill a bunch of kids by simply telling them \" wear these masks and watch TV . \" In reality , that plan would never , ever work , but for some reason , it does in the movie . At the time he tells them to watch the television , it 's at a time of day when most kids are out trick or treating , that , and what kind of kid would actually wear a mask while watching TV ? Those masks looked stuffy as hell . He would probably succeed in only killing less than a quarter of the amount he intended . It 's so utterly ridiculous . The acting is abysmal , and you can say that most acting in the eighties was bad , but that 's a piss poor excuse . The main character , the doctor , is a total buffoon who flirts with every single woman that comes on screen , and most of the time he just manages to bumble his way into success . His \" cute \" female sidekick jumps into bed with him the night she meets him , apparently in the mood for lots of hot sex despite the death of her father earlier that day . They also exchange corny pillow talk before engaging in premarital sex , such as \" Where would you LIKE to sleep ? \" \" That 's a dumb question . \" GOD , I wish I had n't heard something so atrocious . The main villain is apparently one of the most richest people in the world because he sells Halloween masks , rich enough to run his own town and make his own army of suave , studly male robots to do his bidding . Really ... robots ? Yes , the protagonist and his sexed up housewife sidekick get pursued by lumbering , slow - moving robots , which you can apparently kill in one shot just by shoving your fist into their stomachs , yet everyone manages to get murdered by them . Good lord , can anything else be more stupid than that ? \" IT 'S MAGIC ! ! \" Is n't that called a Deus Ex Machina ? Not only did he manage to steal a huge rock , but it for some reason is three times the size of a normal stone from the Stone Hedge , and he implies it took a lot of work to steal it . I 'm sorry , but how do you make stealing one of those rocks inconspicuous ? ! The ending is horrible . The Bond villain 's plans are foiled by the doctor and his sex kitten when he dumps the magic killer chips all over the robots after playing the killer pumpkin show which is ... supposed to ... I guess ... activate the magic in the chips ? I can only assume that 's what it does , that and it can produce rattlesnakes and crickets to come out of your face . I still do n't understand a single bit how that works . You play some pumpkin video and a magic chip makes snakes come out of your mouth ? Yeah we see this all happen to some ginger kid towards the end of the film , which makes for great , gripping cinema , because I 'm sure if it made any sense whatsoever , it might be scary . The Bond villain dies at the end , when ... something ... happens ... like , the computers chips are dumped all over the robot slaves and then while a bunch of pumpkin videos are playing ... the stone from the Hedge ... erupts into ... blue flames ? Anyways , it turns the Bond villain into what looks like a human - shaped wedge of bleu cheese . After breaking out his sex kitten partner , the doctor drives off with her in the seat beside him , and then it 's revealed that ... she 's a robot too . And she tries to strangle him . So he crashes into a tree and her arm gets ripped off so she tries to strangle him with one arm ... and then ... I .. just ca n't explain it any further , it 's just SO GODDAMN STUPID , MY WORDS CANNOT DO IT JUSTICE . So then it 's revealed that stopping the British - accented Bond villain did n't halt the killer pumpkin videos , so the doctor guy decides to call the studio to get it taken off the air . For some reason , some random kids drive up in a car at the gas station he 's at ... I do n't know who they are or where they came from . As they 're watching the pumpkin video with their masks on , the protagonist is telling them to take the videos off the air , on all of the multiple channels it 's apparently running on . The kid watching the TV just keeps changing the channels like a lifeless , emotionless zombie . Really , if all kids were that stupid , I think he should have just left it on the air . He screams for them to take it off of the final channel , but they just leave it on . And it ends there . Why did they take it off of two channels , but not the last one ? That makes a lot of fucking sense . I guess they realized how crazy the guy sounded at the last minute . Oh well . More candy for the adults now that less than 1 % of all kids wearing masks and watching the show are dead . So yeah , James . THAT 'S why Halloween III is bad , not because it does n't have Michael Meyers . You might say \" that 's your opinion . \" It 's my opinion that it 's a motherfucking fact . Also , the only good Halloween was the first film . Second one was okay . The rest , complete garbage . I hated Michael Meyers as a villain , but he was n't much worse than this British suit - wearing Bond guy . It should be its own Halloween series and entitled \" Halloween : Season of the Witch \" , and that 's all . After that , they 'd launch a new sub title . Halloween 1 and 2 are like the Back to the Future series . Its meant to be predestine as a story split into two films and end there . It just does n't fit , as Halloween 1 and 2 barely have anything to do with the holiday . Aside for a few aspects , its mostly about a psychopath who escaped the mental institution and returned home to where he killed his sister due to verious psychological issues . it is a shame halloween 3 was shunned for being so different and on some parts did nt make that much sense but i was nt bothered by it , i saw halloween 3 as a kid and i liked it . though i scratched my head on why it did nt have michael myers but i ignored it . it sucked growing up defending the movie and trying to convince them to just accept it for what it is , a pretty gory and well holiday themed with great music movie . but they would nt i myself get shunned for even mentioning it along with the other halloween movies . but i wo nt give up my opinoin , i will shout it out right now I LIKE HALLOWEEN 3 AND YOU HATERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELFS TO ALLOW THE SERIES TO GO TO RESURRECTION ! ! ! I recently saw 3 and I absolutely loved it . It is a shame they diddn't keep the trend of making it an anthology series instead of endlessly resurrecting Myers . I wonder where it would 've gone from there if they did . I think Zombie should bring this trend back . Mabye not remaking or rebooting 3 , but atleast reimagining it . Pointless sequel ... yet it had balls . It killed off the killer and for me this is where the Halloween series ends as the sequels were terrible ... yes even H20 . However I loved III as it 's something new . Myers is dead anyway . I always see it as a seperate franchise and it 's a shame they did n't continue the idea of a new Halloween story each year . It 's a great flick , it 's scary with some great ideas . Next year James should do a Antholgoy - a - thon for the next Monster Madness . There are some great horror anthology flicks out there for the obvious Creepshow and Twilight Zone to the overlooked Tales From The Crypt ( original English version ) and even Carpenter 's own Body Bags . Stephen King 's Cat 's Eye , The House That Dripped Blood from writer of Psycho Robert Bloch . Monster Club . I could go on and on . More than enough films to do a Monster Madness on . I first saw Halloween III in 1993 , it was also the first ever Halloween flick for me . Even though it did not have Michael Myers at all , I found the film 's concept to be very interesting and at times it does a good job delivering scary moments . I noticed the film proved to be daring in the following concepts : . Emphasizing the commercialization of Halloween . Showing how capitalism made impact on society 's perception of Halloween 3 . The film dared to show the killing of a child in a key scene . Even until now , showing children getting killed on cinema is taboo . It cleverly mixes elements of science fiction with culture and horror . Yea i agree wit u james 100 percent . Halloween 1 and 2 were just great . It was a good story about a evil killer who wanted to wipe out his family . But it ends wit him dying and that s that . But of course some moron wanted to make money and just ruined the whole series from 4 on . Halloween 3 was good . And yea they should of just continued in that direction like u said . A different halloween horror story each movie . Donald Pleasence also plays a character called Loomis in the non - Halloween movie Innocent Bystanders , playing Annie Brackett , one of the cast members in Halloween II , Nancy Kyes , was also called Loomis , her billing name in the credits being Nancy Loomis . There 's actually one major point to H2 that was actually improved over the first movie ; the lighting . It 's something that really stood out to me . There 's this scene where Michael is walking and light is shining through a chain link fence onto his mask . The texture of the lighting gives him an even more eerie , unearthly and chill inducing presence . There are more scenes like this spread throughout the movie , but this one in particular really stood out to me . I love Halloween III , along with the original Halloween & Halloween 4 it 's one of my favorite movies to watch on Halloween . When I was younger it bothered me that Michael Myers was n't in it , but now I just like the film for what it its . damn , now that 's what I call great casting . I just saw Halloween 3 and I have to say in my opinion it 's pretty bad . Quite some things in there that make no sense and it has one of the worst endings in movie history . Now I can understand that people were glad to have Michael Myers back in part four . I did n't even realize Halloween 3 was an official sequel for the longest time . It 's just not a good movie regardless of the title . Halloween 2 is the only worthwhile sequel in the entire franchise . It really should have ended there ... . P.S. The hospital setting is extremely creepy and the only aspect that outdoes the original . The biggest downside of the movie is the revelation that Laurie is Michael 's sister . It was better when Mike was such a nut job that he 's simply compelled to go after the first girl that reminds of his first kill , his sister . Halloween 3 is my personal favorite out of all the movies . It 's a real shame the series did n't receive the variation it needed . Instead the fans reduced the rest f the sequels to rotting pieces of SHIT ! SHIT I tell you ! \n",

      "Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look tacky! Sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. At least the Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! This film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What is with that stupid fish! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! This film is a total off target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. So please if you have the choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess.\n"

      "I ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a Sunday afternoon. Though it was obviously a cheesy TV movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed I was hooked and had to watch it through to the end. I recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign DVD of this film (oops, didn't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior), and was very pleased to be able to watch it again (and in its entirety).I don't wholly understand the phenomenon, but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary. The decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons, but are they actually scary? No, not very. Likewise in the years since the 70s we've gotten horror movies that are cooler, more exciting, have much better production values and sophisticated special effects, are more fun, funnier, have effective \"jump\" moments, and some very creative uses of gore, but again... they aren't really scary! There's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. The grainy film quality. The spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs. The \"edge of dreamland\" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently EQ'd scores. The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. Everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s, in the case of horror, works in its favor.Specifically, in this film, the quiet, intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving. So much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile (\"Cujo\"?). The filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form. The effects when that occurs, while unsophisticated by today's standards, literally gave me chills. The bizarre, vaguely-defined, \"I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at\" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be, rather than the hyper-real, crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films.While the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit, the actors all do a decent job. The pairing of the brother and sister from the \"Witch Mountain\" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine. Yvette Mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular. Richard Crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses. His self-doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté.The movie's The-End-Question-Mark type ending is one of the only ones I've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it.Detractors of this film may say it's merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about \"Blade Runner\". :-)\n",
